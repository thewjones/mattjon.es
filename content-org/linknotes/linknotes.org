**** Needlepoint tapestry representations The Sentinel

https://www.marine.st/fr

Words can't describe how much I love these needlepoint tapestries of screenshots from Geoff Crammond's classic game The Sentinel, by artist Marine Beaufils. I played the BBC Micro version in the 80s but it was identical to the ZX Spectrum version in all its 8-bit glory. These artworks are for sale by contacting Marine
