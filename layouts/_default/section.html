  <h1>All Posts</h1>
  <p>Below are {{ len .Site.RegularPages }} posts written over nearly 23 years. The blog started out as frownland.com in October 2000 and at the time was only one of a handful of UK based 'weblogs'.</p>
  <p>At that time I wrote a lot about tech, web development, web standards and anything else that took my interest, and it gained a small following. <p>

  <p>Only a few years into it I somehow lost interest, let the domain slip and blogging became a more sporadic activity for me as I moved blog archive around various domains. At one point I experimented with self-hosting the blog on an iMac DVSE running Yellow Dog Linux. Madness.</p>

  <p>Still, I'm pleased to have this archive to look back on to see what me as 20-something year old was thinkng about back then.</p>
