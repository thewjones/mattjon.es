Said Hamlet to Ophelia,  
I'll draw a sketch of thee,  

What kind of pencil shall I use?  
2B or not 2B?- [Spike Milligan 1918-2002](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/tv_and_radio/newsid_1843000/1843963.stm)[Some more quotes](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,658891,00.html), I particularly like the last one.
