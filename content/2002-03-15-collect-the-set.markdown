You may remember [my post](http://frownland.com/index.shtml?archive/2002_02_01_archive.html#9919624 ) about Sesame Street's Pinball Song a while back. Well, I forgot to mention that [Jeff Boyd](http://www.joynk.com/jeff) sent me a good quality version of Number 6 [there are variations of the song for each number up to 12]. I had another email from somebody asking me if I have a copy of either the 8 or 10 versions of the song. What is this, a game of swapsies?
