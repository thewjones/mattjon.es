[Dasher](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/DasherSummary.html) is one of the most impressive and revolutionary computer interfaces I have seen for a long time. It allows the user to enter text using very small movements of the input device. This is ideal for palmtop computers as well for use by those who are unable to input text using a keyboard. You can download a demo [here](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/djw30/dasher/download.html), although it doesn't seem to be available for Mac users.
