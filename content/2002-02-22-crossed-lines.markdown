I received a phone call from someone asking me to help out at an event:



	

_'Yes, I'd be happy to help. Do you have a post code for the venue so I can look up a map?'_



	

_'Yes Matt, I'll just get it.'_



	

_'OK, I'll find a pen'_



 At this point, I find a pen on a nearby desk; I'm away from the phone for about five seconds. I sit and wait for the person to find the post code. **Three minutes** later I hear…

	

_'Hello ?'_



	

_'Er… Hello'_



	

_'Have you been on the phone for all this time?'_



	

_'Yes'_



	

_'So have I… I thought you were getting a pen'_



	

_'And I thought you were getting the post code!'_



 We laughed.
