I've just come back from watching [The Lord of The Rings](http://www.thelordoftherings.net/). I've also just returned from Middle Earth where I've just spent the last 3 hours. Yes, the film really does transport you there; the visuals are incredible, the acting is - on the whole - spot on and the effects are dazzling. It's definitely the work of someone who is passionate about the books. There are a few problems here and there, but I'm not going to go on about itâ€¦ just go and see it.
