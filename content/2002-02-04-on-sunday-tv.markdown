[The Antiques Roadshow](http://www.bbc.co.uk/antiques/) is the television equivalent of afternoon tea; china cups and saucers, triangular sandwiches, Battenberg and sponge cake. It's so innocent; that age old format of expert and clueless punter having come along with the hope of their Victorian dinner service being worth roughly the same as their bungalow. There's a certain level of anticipation when you hear the expert say the words 'have you thought about getting it insured?', then we know the silver fly swatter used by Napoleon is going to be worth tens of thousands. I'm just interested in old stuff; things that have history and a story behind them. I've accumulated quite a bit of junk over the last few years; old cameras, typewriters, watches and in a world of mass production and ubiquitous technology, I just like the uniqueness of them.
