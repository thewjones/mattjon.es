[Digital Photography Now](http://dp-now.com/index.html) has a [preview](http://dp-now.com/archives/000677.html) of Epson's unique Digital Rangefinder camera, the RD-1. A collaboration between Epson and traditional Rangefinder maker [Cosina](http://www.cosina.co.jp/), it's a triumph of function over form. Aimed at staunch traditionalists who want to dip a toe into the world of digital photography, it's a camera that looks as if it's been pulled from the 1960s and reluctantly modified with digital components. Strangely, it has what looks like a film advance lever which cocks the shutter before every shot, as well as a film rewind knob which is really a jog dial for changing camera settings. Priced at around 2000 however, its retro design and functionality do not come cheap. (via [Photography Blog](http://www.photographyblog.com/))
