This particular statement in Apple’s marketing blurb for the [new iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/) may owe its catchiness to [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com), but it’s important because I believe the iMac G5 is a true successor to both the original [iMac](http://www.apple-history.com/noframes/body.php?page=gallery&model=imac) released and the original [Macintosh](http://www.apple-history.com/noframes/body.php?page=gallery&model=128k) computer released 20 years ago.

The [G4 ‘anglepoise’ iMac](http://www.apple-history.com/noframes/body.php?page=gallery&model=imac_flat) was a great design, however while it was an all-in-one machine, its form-factor seemed to be a concession to the fact that, at the time, it was impossible to put an LCD display, a G4 processor, associated heatsink and circuitry into the same casing without it looking ugly as hell. With the G4 iMac, the display **wasn’t** the computer, but the two were connected with a distinctive hinge with which you could position the display and carry the machine around.

If Apple perfected how to build a computer round a [Cathode Ray Tube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube) with the Macintosh 128k and the iMac, they’ve certainly perfected building a computer round an LCD with this new machine.
