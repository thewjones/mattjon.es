With the release of [Final Cut Pro 4](http://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/) and [Shake 3](http://www.apple.com/shake/), Apple's suite of digital production [software ](http://www.apple.com/software/pro/) is looking better than ever. What I would give to get my hands on some of this stuff! I don't think such processor-hungry software would run on my trusty [iMac DVSE](http://www.lowendmac.com/imacs/dvse.shtml) though :(
