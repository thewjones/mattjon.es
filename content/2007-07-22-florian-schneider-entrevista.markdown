Kraftwerk's [Florian Schneider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Schneider) never gives interviews, or at least, interviews he takes seriously. For Brazillian TV in 1998, [he gave the interviewer one-word answers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhJJ-KypkBk) as she desperately tried to make them sound more interesting translated into Portuguese.





Here's another, way more bizarre, interview he gave in 2001 under the pseudonym 'Don Schneider'. Being a monoglot, I haven't got a clue what they're saying, but then I suspect a Spanish speaking person wouldn't either.
