In 1991, [Richard Dawkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) presented the [Royal Institution Christmas lectures for Children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Institution_Christmas_Lectures), and to help illustrate our tendency to think we are superior to the rest of the species on the planet, he invited a member of the audience to read an excerpt from [Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitch-hikers_Guide_to_the_Galaxy):

The lecture series, titled 'Growing up the Universe' has [recently been released on DVD](http://richarddawkins.net/article,826,Growing-Up-in-the-Universe-2-Disc-DVD-Set,The-Richard-Dawkins-Foundation-for-Reason-and-Science). I remember it when it was first broadcast on the BBC, and as a 15 year-old who'd had a vaguely Christian education and thus had many unanswered questions about our origins, it was a wonderfully inspiring and educational piece of television.
