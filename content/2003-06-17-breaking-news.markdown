Perhaps symptomatic of living in the post 911 world, when I see the 'breaking news' graphic on [BBC News Online](http://news.bbc.co.uk/) I experience a momentary shudder of fear that it might be another terrorist attack. While I'm relieved when I discover that it isn't, I do expect that striking red graphic to be assigned to news that is worthy of such urgency and not to news that some [Harry Potter books have been stolen](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2996718.stm) (again). Might I suggest that the BBC vary the look of their 'breaking news' graphics so that less important news is broken slightly more calmly? Maybe something like thisâ€¦
