title: Lack of Inspiration

I've been suffering from a general lack of inspiration just recently. I usually make time to post here, but I haven't felt compelled to over the last few days. I'm sure my lack of motivation will pass and things will be back to normal though. ::. The [icab](http://www.icab.de/) browser is a fast and efficient alternative to IE5.1/OSX. It doesn't have full CSS support yet, but it will do I'm sure.
