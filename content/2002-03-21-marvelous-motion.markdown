I turned on the TV and slumped into a chair after a long day at work to find myself jaw agape at BBC1's new series [Weird Nature](http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/weird/). This week, the programme explored how different animals move around and it contained some absolutely stunning camera work and special effects. Definitely a must-see: Weird Nature, Thurdays at 8.30pm on BBC1.
