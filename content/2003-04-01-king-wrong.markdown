It is my opinion that films in which giant gorillas fall in love with human females should be left firmly in 1933. There's no doubt that [King Kong](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0024216) is a classic film and its effects broke new ground at the time, but surely these are two reasons for it **not** to be [remade](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2905249.stm).
