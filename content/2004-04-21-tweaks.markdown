As well as adjusting the title text above, I've added 'Listening to' information to the floating widget below. It's generated using Freshly Squeezed Software's [Recent Tunes](http://freshlysqueezedsoftware.com/products/freeware/) menu bar tool. When iTunes is running, it displays the current tune, when it isn't, there's a link to what I've been listening to [recently](http://helium3.blogdns.com/recenttunes.html).
