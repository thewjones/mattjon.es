Paris' experimental moving walkway, the [Trottoir Roulant Rapide](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3001182.stm) (Fast Rolling Pavement), reminds me of a transportation device described in Asimov's 1950s Sci-fi classic [The Caves of Steel](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Caves_of_Steel). In it, city dwellers travel on what are called 'strips', parallel walkways which travel progressively faster from left to right; the idea being that as you walk across them you gradually gain speed and before you know it, you're whizzing along towards your destination. The difference with the TRR - apart from not being the product of Sci-fi fantasy - is that the acceleration/deceleration zones are in series and not in parallel, although judging by warnings given to those using the TRR, this doesn't make it any easier to ride. The [BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3001182.stm ) has a nice flash presentation to explain how it works.
