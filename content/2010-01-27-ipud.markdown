When Apple introduced the iPhone, it was like Steve Jobs reached through a mysterious wormhole and pulled from within it an object from five years into the future; its design and user interface were like nothing seen before.

With the iPad, it's like Jobs picked up a five year old magazine article about what Apple might have in store for the future, and based their new product on that. It's even called iPad.

Many of us who are underwhelmed, however, may remember that the iPod was met with [similar disappointment](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=500) (and derision for its name) when it was first released.

Or maybe we're all just Apple obssessed idiots.
