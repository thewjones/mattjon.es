Tonight, 19:30 on Channel 4: 'Jon Snow presents a profile of photographer Joel Meyerowitz as he records the aftermath and the reflections of the New York's citizens after the September 11 attacks'When [Stu](http://www.t-melt.com) and I studied photography at Foundation level, Meyerowitz's work really inspired us. The level of detail and the quality of the light in his photographs is incredible [he uses a gorgeous 10, 8 [Deardorff view camera](http://deardorffcameras.0catch.com/)]. If you ever see copies of [Cape Light](http://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/index.html?books/clI.html~main), [St Louis & The Arch](http://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/index.html?books/slI.html~main) or [Nature of Cities](http://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/index.html?books/noc.html~main), check them out.**Update:** There's an article about the programme [here](http://www.channel4.com/news/home/20011114/Story03.htm) [via [t-melt](http://www.t-melt.com)].
