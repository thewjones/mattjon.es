### Rising CO2 causes more than a climate crisis — it may directly harm our ability to think

https://phys.org/news/2020-04-co2-climate-crisisit-ability.html

Another one about air quality, because I think the quality of the air we breathe is pretty fundamental. This is one aspect of rising CO2 concentrations that rarely gets talked about. 

Before the Industrial Revolution, the global average CO2 concentration in the atmosphere was around 280 ppm. Between 400 and 1000 ppm is considered a normal levels for indoor concentration of CO2, with the higher levels of this indoor range being the point at which we may start to feel the need for fresh air. The current global average C02 concentration is over 400 ppm with the projection - if we do nothing to lower CO2 emissions - of over 900 ppm by 2100. This could make average indoor CO2 level pretty uncomfortable and affect our ability to think in indoor spaces with poor airflow.

### Air pollution may be ‘key contributor’ to Covid-19 deaths – study

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/air-pollution-may-be-key-contributor-to-covid-19-deaths-study

Given the nature of this respiratory disease and its impact on the global population, when the lockdown restrictions start easing up it seems entirely inappropriate for everyone to go back to their diesel and petrol powered cars for urban transport.

Since lockdown restrictions have been eased in China, the country has seen a drop in the use of public transport and a rise in the use of private cars (comparative to before the outbreak).

In the UK, with pressure to restart the economy, major cities are postponing plans to introduce Clean Air Zones and congestion charges with the view that people will be avoiding public transport and instead use cars to travel into the city-centres.

Transport isn't this binary choice between public transport and the private car. Cycling and walking are viable transport and travel solutions for the many people living in towns and cities, and this includes may people who are disabled use bicycles and adapted cycles as mobility aids.

### How you can help plot the future of UK walking – from a standstill

https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment-and-conservation/2020/04/how-you-can-help-plot-future-of-uk-walking-standstill

Slow Ways is a project to plot over 4000 walking routes linking every UK village, town and city. 

Our perception of distance between places has been shaped by the road network that we've built mainly for car travel. In the same way the the London tube map distorts the distance between places in London (it's usually quicker to walk between two stations on the same line), settlements in the UK are often closer together than we think they are.

### Helm software synthesizer. You use it to create electronic music on your computer.

https://tytel.org/helm

I've recently starting to produce and perform electronic music main using software written under the GNU Free Software license. My setup uses a number of pieces of software working together, a combination of step sequencers and arpeggiators to trigger notes and synth software that is generating the sounds. One of my favourite pieces of sound-generating software is Helm, written by Matt Tytel. 

The theory of sound synthesis has always been a bit baffling to me. If you've ever
