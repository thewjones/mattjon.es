### Ox-Hugo: Org to Markdown for Hugo {#ox-hugo-org-to-markdown-for-hugo}

<https://ox-hugo.scripter.co>

For quite a number of years now, this site has been produced using a static-site generator called Hugo. I write Markdown files, run 'hugo' and and within a fraction of a second 1800+ posts are packaged up into a set of HTML files ready to deploy. If that wasn't esoteric enough, I use Emacs with Org Mode to write and manage my posts in one .org file. OrgMode is basically a todo / planner system for Emacs with lots of nerdy features that I'll never use or fully understand.
