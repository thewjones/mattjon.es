### Van Gogh Museum Virtual Tour

With no-one able to visit them, museums and galleries around the world are coming up with solutions for people to experience their collections.

I like these simple high resolution videos from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam which recreate your point of view as if you were walking around the gallery.

### The British Museum has published 2 million images under a Creative Commons license

https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection

Other museums are taking different approaches by placing vast collections of images online under public domain or Creative Commons licenses.

The British Museum has just realised 2 million images of its collection, although the presence of this artefacts in the museum isn't without [controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum#Controversies).
