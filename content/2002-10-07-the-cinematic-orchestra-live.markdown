[The Cinematic Orchestra](http://www.cinematicorchestra.com/) brought their unique blend of jazz, soul and 'meaty hip hop-funk-swing' to Newcastle on Saturday night and while I was a little unsure beforehand about how well the recorded material would be performed live, I was very impressed, indeed. Most of the material they played was from their latest album '[Every Day](http://www.boomkat.com/item.cfm?merchID=7205)' and included some fantastic improvisation from saxophonist Tom Chant and drummer Luke Flowers. Here are their remaining tour dates:
