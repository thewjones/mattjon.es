title: History of CGI in Film and Television

There's a fascinating [Wikipedia entry showing a timeline of the use of Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) in film and TV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_CGI_in_film_and_television).


	

For me, there are a few notable things about this list:


	


		
  * I would not have considered [Westworld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld) as being the first film to contain CGI. As I recall, 'Yul Brynner-vision' doesn't look particularly CGI-like (which is probably a good thing)

		
  * I never knew [Westworld had a sequel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futureworld)

		
  * The use of vector graphics in Star Wars is certainly believable, seeing as the classic vector generated [Atari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari) game was released only a few years later

		
  * I always thought that, like The Guide sequences in the TV version of [HHGTG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HHGTTG), all the effects in [Tron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_%28film%29) were traditionally animated. It seems that this not the case as the Lightcycle sequences were CGI. 

		
  * I never knew [John Lasseter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter) made a short computer animated film while he worked at [Lucasfilm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm) (before [Pixar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar)). I always thought Luxo was the first fully CGI animated short film.

		
  * The 'stained glass knight' (created by John Lasseter) in [Young Sherlock Holmes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Sherlock_Holmes) scared the hell out of me.

		
  * Now you may be tempted to think that [Labyrinth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_%28film%29) is a 80s fantasy film of the cheesiest order. Well it is, but directed by Jim Henson, this film ripples with a level of inventiveness you just don't see in today's Hollywood films.
