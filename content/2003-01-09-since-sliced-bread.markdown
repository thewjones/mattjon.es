This Christmas, I was fortunate to receive a design classic; a product that does its job so effectively and in such an entertaining way that it deserves to be up there with the [Apple Macintosh](http://www.theapplemuseum.com/index.php?id=tam&page=personal&subpage=mac) and [The Mini](http://www.steve-marshall.co.uk/mini/info/index.php). It has large yellow feet and an on/off switch; it wears a rather fetching red hat which doubles as a measuring container and if its form isn't enough propel it into the premiership of product design, it functions as a popcorn maker. No home should be withoutâ€¦ a [Duck Popper](http://www.prima-international.com/prima/party/hi-res_pdp100.jpg).
