By way of a tribute to [George Harrison](http://www.allthingsmustpass.com/), I bought [Withnail & I](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0094336) on [DVD](http://www.play.com/play247.asp?page=search&adudisc=y) the other day [Harrison was the executive producer]. It is perhaps annoying that it has been adopted by obnoxious students to form the basis of a drinking game and as an endless source of drunkeness related quotes. However, it remains a classic film; a testiment to the fact that if you have a good script which contains themes that relate to real-life situations, then you don’t need a big budget to achieve greatness. The DVD contains an excellent commentary from Paul McGann and Ralph Brown which gives an interesting insight to the making of the film and exactly what was going on inside the head of the films ‘conductor’ Bruce Robinson.
