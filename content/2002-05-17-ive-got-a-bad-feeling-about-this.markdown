That line had to be in there somewhere, but overall, I really enjoyed the [latest installment](http://www.starwars.com). Christopher 'Bruce' Lee's performance made it for me though.[The Case for the Empire](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/248ipzbt.asp) is a ridiculously in-depth analysis of the political struggle portrayed in the Star Wars saga. As Jonathan V. Last argues, things aren't as they seem.
