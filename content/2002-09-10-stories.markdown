[Jeff](http://life.outtacontext.com) emailed to tell me about a project of his:



	

'_[Dichotomy: It Was a Matter of Time and Place](http://outtacontext.com/dichotomy) asks people to submit their stories of September 11th as well as how this date has affected them in the last year from two different perspectives. Participants, those who experienced the events firsthand in New York and Washington or Witnesses, those who experienced the day via the media, are both encouraged to post_.'



	

On a different note, I'm taking a break for a while, so don't expect any updates for a few days. So long.
