title: Control-P Print!

After updating to OS X [Jaguar](http://www.apple.com/macosx/), my machine failed to recognise my [Epson C42UX](http://www.epson.co.uk/sohoprod/printers/inkjet/styc42/index.htm) printer. Epson do seem to be slow in keeping the drivers up to date for Mac OS X, which is where utilities such as [Gimp-Print](http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/MacOSX.php3) come in very handy. It bypasses the use of drivers by printer manufacturers by using Jaguars own open source print spooler.
