It may seem a little odd for a book called '[On Photography](http://www.susansontag.com/onphotography.htm)' to contain no photographs within its pages. Despite this, Susan Sontag's collection of essays remains - 26 years after it was first published - one of the most important books written about the role of the photographic image in our lives. Her latest book, '[Regarding the Pain of Others](http://www.susansontag.com/regardingpain.htm)', continues this theme but with specific reference to "the contemporary depiction of war and disaster".   

Sontag's recent 3 hour(!) interview for the American channel [C-Span](http://www.c-span.org/) - in which she discusses photography as well as war with Iraq amongst other things - can be viewed [here](http://www.booktv.org/ram/feature/0303/btv030103_4.ram) (requires the [RealOne Player](http://www.real.com)).
