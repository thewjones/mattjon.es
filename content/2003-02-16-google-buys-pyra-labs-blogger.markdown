In news that's set to tear the roof off the Blogosphere [well maybe], [Google has bought Pyra Labs](http://slashdot.org/articles/03/02/16/0728230.shtml?tid=187), the company behind [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com). Two years ago, Google did the same to another community building website, DejaNews and in doing so allowed [20 years](http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html) worth of Newsgroup communications to be searched using Googles legendary user interface. It will be interesting to see if this has an equally positive effect on the weblog medium and the extent to which it will change the way Blogger works. [Ev](http://www.evhead.com) has stated that it will give Pyra the "_resources to build on the vision I've been working on for years_". Exciting stuff.
