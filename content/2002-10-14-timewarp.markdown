To celebrate roughly two years of nonsense at this site, I've decided to use the [PHP style switcher](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/phpswitch/) at this weeks ALA to throw this site back in time to how it looked in October 2000 [over there, in the sidebar, see?].  It's been a rewarding couple of years; my knowledge of web design and programming has increased immeasurably and I've made some great friends. Soâ€¦ thank you!



   Incidentally, the actual birth of this site was probably in September of 2000, but I don't think I published it until October. Anyway, I'm terrible at remembering birthdays!
