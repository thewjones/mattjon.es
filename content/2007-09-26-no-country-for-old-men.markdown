[The Coen Brothers'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_Brothers) latest film, based on a novel by [Cormac McCarthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy), will be released in the UK on January 18th. I'm part way through the book, which is a great read.





From what I can gather so far, if you liked [Fargo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/), you'll love this film.
