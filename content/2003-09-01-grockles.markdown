Thanks to all those who wished me well for my holiday/vacation and for the highly entertaining [Tomato discussion](http://frownland.com/archive/2003/august/killer_tomato.html) while I was gone. As you might have guessed, Michelle and I went down to the New Forest (her own neck of the woods) for a while and we popped across to Devon for a spot of [festival-going](http://www.beautifuldays.org/) and camping at the South Devon coast. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to discuss where at the South Devon coast we stayed. You see, each conversation we had with a local went something like:



	


	
  * Them: Hello. Where are you from?

		
  * Us: Cheshire and The New Forest originally. We're currently living near Newcastle Upon Tyne.

		
  * Them: That's a long way awayâ€¦ so how did you find this place then?

		
  * Us: Well, we were driving round looking for a campsite and this looked like a nice place to stay.

		
  * Them: Oh. Well you just make you sure you don't tell anyone about it, OK?. We don't want too many people round 'ere.

		
  * Us: Erm. OK.   

	

	

You see, we were [Grockles](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A701623).
