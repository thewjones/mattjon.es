Google have introduced a BETA version of [Froogle](http://froogle.google.com), a Google style interface to hundreds of online shops. At first I thought this was some kind of joke, mainly because it's a Google product that isn't called Google. I suppose their brand is so strong that they can get away with this; I mean it's not a great pun is it?
