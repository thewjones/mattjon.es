Back in November, when proper news was at a premium, the BBC [reported](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2415095.stm) that a Grandfather had ruthlessly shot down a Squirrel that had been terrorising innocent by-standers in, of all places, [Knutsford](http://www.virtual-knutsford.co.uk/).



	

Now it seems the [Badgers are at it](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/3023369.stm); maybe they'll gang up with the Squirrels and go around causing more trouble. Anyway, on my return to the BBC article about the terror squirrel, I noticed [Scary Squirrel World](http://www.scarysquirrel.org), a site set up to document this disturbing trend in rodent hooliganism. Watch out for the [Red-Eyed Cyclopic Tree Chaser.](http://www.scarysquirrel.org/special/treed/)
