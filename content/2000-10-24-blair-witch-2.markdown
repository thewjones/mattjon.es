[Blair Witch 2](http://www.blairwitch.com) looks like a pretty forgettable film judging by the trailer - another crap teen horror flick to add alongside the likes of Scream and er… oh i've forgotten the others already. At least the original Blair Witch Project had something different and interesting about it.  Having said that, the [trailer for the sequel](http://www.apple.com/trailers/artisan/blair_witch2_trailer.html) did provide me with one of the funniest moments of my week so far - just check out the **comedy** owl nearly half way through. I don't know whether this is supposed to be funny or not but it had me in hysterics. It's particularly effective if you pause the Quicktime on the frame and intake the sheer pathetic-ness of it… timeless.
