Apple have released some new [PowerMac G4](http://www.apple.com/powermac/) machines with a new face. It seems like they're really squeezing all they can out of the old the four-handled design which dates back to the blueberry G3s. It looks a bit ugly, but I suppose if you're a power user, looks aren't a priority. The fact that you can run [two 23 inch cinema displays](http://www.apple.com/powermac/graphics.html) simultaneously off it is pretty impressive though.
