I'm quite tempted to take part in [National Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.com/); 4 weeks to write a 50,000 word novel. 'Because of the limited writing window, the ONLY thing that matters in NaNoWriMo is output. It's all about quantity, not quality. The kamikaze approach forces you to lower your expectations, take risks, and write on the fly.'
