title: I've Met Ive!

None other than [Jonathan Ive](http://macweek.zdnet.com/1999/11/14/ukfri.html) [lead designer at [Apple](http://www.apple.com) and the person responsible for the [iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/) and the [Cube](http://www.apple.com/powermaccube/) etc] was here in [the office](http://www.cfid.co.uk) the other day. He was picking up an honourary degree from [Northumbria Uni](http://www.unn.ac.uk) where he studied Industrial Design 10 years ago [the course I do a bit of teaching on]. He had an ‘entourage’ of university VIP types around him and I’m sure he really couldn’t be arsed with it all. Even though he’s probably worth a few million and he’s helped [Apple](http://www.apple.com) out of the doldrums [for a while anyway] he seems quite a modest chap who hates the formality of these occasions. The current 3rd Year of the Industrial Design course are collaborating with Ive/Apple on a project – lucky so and so’s.
