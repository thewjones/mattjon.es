There are no [fibreglass cows](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/arts/newsid_2042000/2042730.stm) here in Newcastle, although there is [walking french bread](http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/culturecapital/baltic_breadman.shtml). High profile street-art does seem to be the in thing at the moment.
