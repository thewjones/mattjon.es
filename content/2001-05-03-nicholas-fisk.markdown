When I was around the age of 11 or 12, I was a big fan of a children's fiction author called Nicholas Fisk. He wrote books that were key in developing my interest in science, technology and in particular artificial intelligence. One particular book, 'Robot Revolt', is a story set in the near future where sentient humanoid devices are used as household servants. The book centres around a particular family who buy a top of the range 'Mk III' robot called Max. Max is the only one of his kind around; he is sleaker and more intelligent than every household robot on the street. However, things take a sinister turn when the robot population of the town - lead my Max - revolt against their masters. It's very much novel about the Frankenstein complex, which is something [Isaac Asimov](http://www.clark.net/pub/edseiler/WWW/asimov_home_page.htm) tried to dispel in his robot novels [which I then went on to read]. In Asimov's novel's, humanoid robots live in harmony with humans under [the three laws](http://members.evansville.net/bob/robots/laws.html ) that govern them and they are given equal rights as members of society. The amazing thing is that Asimov was writing about this in the fifties, when there was a predominant fear of technology, especially technology which mimicks human beings. I'm surprised that Asimov's name doesn't appear more in the run up to the release of [Spielberg's A.I.](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0212720). I know the short story was written by [Brian Aldiss](http://www.brianwaldiss.com/ ), but Asimov was working with the same themes much earlier and much more expansively.
