Everyones favourite image format, [PNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/#history), seems to be under threat from the most unlikely sourceâ€¦ [Apple](http://www.apple.com/). It has been revealed that they own a patent for a component of PNG that allows for [alpha transparency](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngintro.html#alpha).
