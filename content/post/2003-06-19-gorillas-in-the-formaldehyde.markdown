title: Gorillas in the Formaldehyde

If looking at weird biological specimens suspended in jars is your idea of a good afternoon out, then I can recommend a visit to the [Darwin Centre](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/darwincentre/) at the [Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk) in London. When I was in the capital a few weeks ago, I met up with [Stu](http://www.t-melt.com) and we decided to pay a visit.



	

Containing a staggering 22 million specimens, the Centre is a valuable resource for scientists as well as a place for laypeople to learn about bioscience. As well as a program of [talks and events](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/darwincentre/live/), there is also a free tour of the laboratories and storage rooms; so, donning the supplied lab coats, Stu and I went in to see what biological oddities we could find. In chilled rooms, pervaded by the smell of [Formaldehyde](http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=formaldehyde&go=Go), row after row of metal lockers contain specimens collected, categorised and indexed, some of them by [Darwin](http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?search=charles+darwin&go=Go) himself. The final room on the tour was a larger laboratory around which were specimens too big for the storage lockers; Sharks, Octopi, even a [Hairy Angler Fish](http://www.imagequest3d.com/catalogue/deepsea/pages/l043.htm) upside-down in its jar, looking even more annoyed.



	

While some may argue that the best place for these animals is in their natural habitat and not in a jar, it's important to remember that the purpose of this place is not just for people like to me come and look at these creatures; the Darwin Centre plays an important role as a place of research and study of life on our planet. By studying these animals in their preserved form, we develop a greater understanding of them and how they evolved and with this understanding comes a greater respect for the natural world.
