Here's an idea so simple and brilliant that you might wish you'd thought of it yourself; a writer scrawls words instead of the usual luminous identifying marks on the backs of sheep, creating [random poetry](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2541761.stm) as they mill around, vacantly chewing cud, munching grass and being flustered by Skip the farmers dog. These poetry sheep are on a farm in [Morpeth](http://www.morpethnet.co.uk/), about 12 miles from where I live and it's a testament to the craziness of the internet that I only found out about it via Anne's Ottawa-based [weblog](http://www.purselipsquarejaw.org).
