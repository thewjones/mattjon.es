One of the best things you can do if you visit [BALTIC](http://www.balticmill.com) is go to the bookshop, find a book of photographs by William Eggleston called '[2 1/4](http://www.photoeye.com/booktease/tt086/Page1.html)' and look at it. I stood there looking at it for while, grinning from ear to ear.



	

One of the worst things you can do if you visit [BALTIC](http://www.balticmill.com) is go to the bookshop and spend Â£50 on the book of photographs by William Eggleston called '[2 1/4](http://www.photoeye.com/booktease/tt086/Page1.html)' . That would make me very jealous.
