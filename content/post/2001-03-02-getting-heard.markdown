The mp3 revolution is allowing unsigned musicians the chance to get their music heard by the masses without spending a fortune on CD production. Unfortunately, it also allows very bad musicians to get their work online. Here's [mp3.com's worst of the worst](http://stations.mp3s.com/stations/44/the_worst_of_the_worst_ver.html). Personally, I like the sound of 'Hallucinogenic Gyro' by [The Farmingdale Sound Machine](http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/60/the_farmingdale_sound_mach.html). Hmm.
