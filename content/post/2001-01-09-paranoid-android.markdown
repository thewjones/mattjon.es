This from Stu:  

  

"Do a Napster search for "Paranoid Android" by [Brad Mehldau](http://www.imnworld.com/mehldau.htm). It's a very nice cover version of the [Radiohead](http://www.radiohead.com) track, and it kinda shows how good their music isâ€¦"  

  

This guy's is definitely one for the Amazon [wishlist](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/wishlist/36JB10C9FXK9R/026-5228695-8161267)
