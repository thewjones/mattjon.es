Here's a response from [Warwick University](http://www.warwick.ac.uk) regarding my last post:'Please do not believe all you read in the newspapers. The Daily Mail for instance could not even get my name right! -the University is actually
  

actively encouraging students to put out their flags during the world
  

cup and their are many university posters around the campus saying this.
  

 All we asked was that they wait until  the world cup starts, which of
  

course it has now begun the England team are now on site, and to take
  

them down when the world cup is over.
  

Out of our 18,000 students only 6 refused to wait and refused to take
  

their flags and bunting down until the World cup campaign had started
  

which of course it has now with England arriving in Korea. IF those 6
  

want to be  unco-oparative that's sad but fine - we are leaving them  to
  

it.
  

As for non externally visible flags they can have them up in their
  

rooms whenever they like - there have never been restrictions on this.
  

We restrict external flags to special occasions  such as Royal events
  

etc.
  

The University has no problem with UK flags - if you look at the
  

University's home page www.warwick.ac.uk You will even see a link to the
  

world cup stuff and a  St George's cross and a history of the flag so we
  

clearly do not believe in that politically correct nonsense about the
  

flags upsetting other nationalities  or being racist.Peter Dunn
