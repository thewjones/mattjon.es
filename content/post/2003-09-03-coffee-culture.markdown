To commemorate 75 since the discovery of penicillin, The Royal Society of Chemistry have started a [competition to find the mouldiest coffee mug](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3077300.stm). Sir Alexander Fleming discovered Penicillin after leaving a Petri dish festering in the lab one summer. 



	

Rather than chancing upon a half-drunk mug of coffee and sending a photograph of it in, I expect people will choose to experiment by seeing what furry bacterial cultures they can grow in their coffee mugs by placing them strategically in warm, poorly ventilated areas around the house. This reminds me of [the Stinky Meat project](http://www.thespark.com/science/stinkymeat/day1/index.html), a site not to be viewed if:



	


	
  * You're about to eat meat

		
  * You're in the process of eating meat

		
  * You've just eaten meat

		
  * You're a vegetarian
