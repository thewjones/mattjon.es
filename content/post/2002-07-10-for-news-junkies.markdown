[Slashdock](http://homepage.mac.com/stas/slashdock.html) is a great little OS X app that sits in the Dock and supplies news headlines via [RSS](http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/intro/). It also has built-in support for [Versiontracker](http://www.versiontracker.com); just go to the preferences panel, enter the number of results you want displayed and you'll have access to the latest OS X software directly from your desktop.
