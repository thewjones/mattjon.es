I really had no idea it was Pancake Day today, that is, until [Phil](http://www.xlab.co.uk) pointed it out. Thank goodness for non-stick pans, that's what I say.
  


  

        You know that new personal site I'm working on, the one I told you about [ages ago](http://frownland.com/index.shtml?archive/2001_11_01_archive.html#6811079 )? Well, I'm still working on it.[PixelNHance](http://www.versiontracker.com/moreinfo.fcgi?id=8889&db=macosx) is a nice piece of OS X freeware that allows you to quickly correct the colour balance etc. on any digital image. Who needs Photoshop X anyway ?
