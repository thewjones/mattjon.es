Today, one my students told me that her parents are about to buy her a [Mac](http://www.apple.com), but she's not sure which one to get. She didn't know about the [G4 Powerbook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/) until I told her about it, so guess what she is going to ask Mummy and Daddy for now? Makes you sick, no?
