If you enjoy listening to jazzy leftfield instrumental music, you'll like much of the output from the Leaf label. They've just launched [a new website](http://www.posteverything.com/leaf/) on which you can find out about the artists and up-coming releases etc. Perhaps the best [or worst depending on the state of your bank balance] element of the site is the excellent, easy-to-use online ordering system. So why not fritter away your cash and buy some good music? A few recommendations: [Leaf Compilation](http://www.posteverything.com/artists/release.php?id=182), [Gorodisch: Thurn & Taxis](http://www.posteverything.com/artists/release.php?id=1218) and [Manitoba: Start Breaking My Heart](http://www.posteverything.com/artists/release.php?id=134).
