[Butterflies and Wheels](http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com)





A site I've been enjoying recently. From the [about page](http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/about.htm):





<blockquote>There are two motivations for setting up the web site. The first is the common one having to do with the thought that truth is important, and that to tell the truth about the world it is necessary to put aside whatever preconceptions (ideological, political, moral, etc.) one brings to the endeavour.
