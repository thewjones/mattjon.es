Apparently, Tom Jenkinson (aka [Squarepusher](http://www.nothingisnext.com/bands/squarepusher/)) is playing bass as part of an experimental jazz night at the The Bridge Hotel in Newcastle tomorrow night. It's pretty rare that something like this happens in Newcastle 'cos no-one can be arsed to come all the way up here and play.
