title: BBC Cult Website to Close

I left this comment on the [BBC Cult](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/) site on [news that it will be shut down](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2005/06/24/20186.shtml) and most of the content will be removed.

There are probably tens of thousands of web pages out there that link to content on this site, all of which will now have dead links thanks to this stupid decision. Sure, the BBC can save money by removing the resource going into the maintenance of these pages, but what saving is there in removing the pages themselves? A bit of bandwidth? A gig or two of server space?
