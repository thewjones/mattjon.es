title: He's Got a Hook for a Hand, Let's Get Him

Today, the Bush administration followed their warning of possible terrorist attacks on US interests with the [arrest of the British Muslim cleric Abu Hamza](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3754651.stm). It's as if they sat down with a list of potential terrorist associates who happen to be in the public eye with the aim of determining who they can 'get' easily in order to take the heat off them for a while. Hamza possesses just the right kind of bad-guy profile to make the public believe that the coalition are slowly but surely removing the threat of global terrorism. Unfortunately, this will never happen, and I fear that arresting the likes of Hamza will only make the threat worse.
