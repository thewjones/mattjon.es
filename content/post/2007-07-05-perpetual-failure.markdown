![](/images/perpetual.jpg)Today is the day Steorn were supposed to be demonstrating their Perpetual Motion Machine via a live Webcast. Perhaps unsurprisingly, if you visit [their website](http://www.steorn.com/orbo/demo/), you will see this announcement:





<blockquote>"We are experiencing some technical difficulties with the demo unit in London. Our initial assessment indicates that this is probably due to the intense heat from the camera lighting. We have commenced a technical assessment and will provide an update later today. As a consequence, Kinetica will not be open to the public today (5th July). We apologise for this delay and appreciate your patience."

So the unveiling of the most important invention in the history of humanity was ruined by some hot lights. Remember, next time you plan on demonstrating an impossible machine, make sure the environmental conditions are right!
