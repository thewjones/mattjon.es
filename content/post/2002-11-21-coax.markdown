[The BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk) has made some modifications to its front page, including a neat way of coaxing users to sections of the site that they don't tend to visit often. The front page is a layout of blue panels; after clicking on a section such as news or sport and then returning back to the front page, you'll notice that the panel you clicked is a deeper shade of blue. Over time, sections of the site that you don't visit will become more highlighted. Clever. [via [blackbeltjones](http://www.blackbeltjones.com)]
