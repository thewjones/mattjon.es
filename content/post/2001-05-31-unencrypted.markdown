"Sending an unencrypted e-mailâ€¦ is like posting a letter without an envelope" - Euro-MPs recommend that [we encrypt our emails](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_1357000/1357264.stm) after they discover that a mysterious spy network called [Echelon](http://www.echelonwatch.org/) may be intercepting our mails and reading them. I suggest that instead of encryption, simply place the words 'Hello Echelon' somewhere in your mails.
