Wouldn't mind going to see [Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0190332) tonight, but I'm playing 5-a-side football instead. I've got the choice of a sitting in a nice warm cinema watching an excellent film or running around in the freezing cold for an hour chasing a ball round (occasionally trying to hit it into a net). So which would you rather do?... yes, I knowâ€¦ it's just that a) I'm slightly bonkers, b) it's good cardio-vascular exercise and c) I'd feel guilty if I didn't play because my team would be a man down. Anyway, I quite enjoy it, not that I'm a major football fan or anything -quite the opposite, I don't really understand the football obsession that afflicts a high percentage of people in this country (especially [Geordies](http://www.geordiepride.demon.co.uk/geordietruth.htm)).
