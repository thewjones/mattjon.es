You may remember, a few weeks ago, I conducted a [poll](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/article/60) to find out the direction of your conjugate lateral eye movement, i.e., the direction in which you look when you think about something. Now, if there's one thing I learnt from the doing this, it's that when choosing options for a poll, you should try and think of every answer that people could respond with. In this case, I only offered 2 options: 'left' and 'right'; whereas I should have perhaps offered  'up' and 'down' and of course 'don't know'. Anyway, we did learn something from the poll, regardless of the fact that it wasn't done properly; we discovered that [most](http://vote.sparklit.com/poll.spark/673794) of the people who visit this site look to the left when they think. Which means that most of you are visual rather than symbolic thinkers and most of you are creative people. Well done, because I look to the left too.
