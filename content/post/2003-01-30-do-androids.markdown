[Stu](http://www.t-melt.com) pointed me in the direction of [](”http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/2002_dec/interview_tessa_dick.html<br)
">this interview with Tessa, Chris and Renea Dick: respectively, the former wife, son and daughter-in-law of [Philip K. Dick](http://www.philipkdick.com/). It gives insight into the way PKD worked as well giving some opinion on the various films that have been based on his books. I've read quite a few of Dick's novels but it is only recently that I picked up 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'; I kind of stalled reading it because I thought I knew the story, it being the novel on which [Blade Runner](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0083658) is based. I was wrong; the book is very different from the film, so much so that I think it could be re-made as a film that follows the book more closely. It wouldn't have to share the future-noir ambience of Blade Runner; the darkness is suggested in the novel, but [Ridley Scott](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Scott,+Ridley) really took this and amplified it for cinematic effect in the film. There's no doubt that Blade Runner is a great piece of cinema, but it really did skim the surface of the themes explored in the book. Maybe 'Do Androids…' can't be properly translated into a film, although I'd really like to see another director have a go.
