title: St George's Day

Apparently, it is [St. George's day](http://www.angelfire.com/mi/resumeandarticles/page1.281html ) today, but I had to watch the news this morning before I knew that… such is my ignorance about such things and I suspect the same goes for a large percentage of the English population. I mean what are the traditional things to do on St. George's day? Hunt down fiery dragons and slay them? Most people don't know… and to be honest, I don't either. Unlike the Scots, the Irish and the Welsh, the English don't really share a sense of national identity or a feeling of heritage, simply because we are such a multi-cultural nation. To me, this is a good thing… OK, it is good to have a sense of history and value heritage, but I think the coalescing of different cultures and religions is much more of an event to be celebrated.
