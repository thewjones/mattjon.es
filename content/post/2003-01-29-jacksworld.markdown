Welcome to Jacksworld, where popular is **best**. In Jacksworld, everyone cowers in the face of corporate might and lovingly buys what they are told. After a hard days work in the Microsoft Office, effortlessly sharing Word documents by Outlook attachment, Jacksworld citizens settle in front of their prided [VHS recorders](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/comment/story/0,12449,881780,00.html) and consume their freshly microwaved Marks & Spencer ready-meals. Best is what the next-door neighbours have; a recursive nightmare of consumer choice pervading the Ford Focus lined streets. In Jacksworld, everyone buys the same, does the same, thinks the same; it's easier that way, better in fact.   

If you're wondering, [Jack](http://www.onlineblog.com) is a journalist for The Guardian who succeeds in making my blood boil every other lunchtime.
