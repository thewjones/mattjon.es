So says Martin Isherwood, writer of this years [nul points](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2935874.stm) UK entry into the Eurovision Song Contest. If the Eurovision results table is a measure of country unpopularity - the songs being of secondary importance - then it seems the UK is not well liked at the moment. That said, the lack of points could simply be due to the song being crap, in which case it's about time John Shuttleworth got his chance to represent us with his haunting ballad ['Pigeons in Flight'.](http://www.shuttleworths.co.uk/chatone.html)
