I have great respect for people whose talents lie in being able to do near impossible - if trivial - things. A few weeks ago, I posted a video of David Bernal aka Elsewhere (the guy in the Orange shirt) doing his incredible [body-popping routine](http://www.kollaboration.org/movie/kolla2001.wmv) (WMV file 3.7MB). This time, here's Tom Baker (no, not Dr Who), performing [a near impossible trick with 2 basketballs](http://lukeburrages.thingonthe.net/juggling/videos/tombaker.mpg) (MPG 984KB). What I really like about this is the look of surprise on Tom's face when he successfully pulls it off.
