title: Processing Huygens Image Data

Watching the press conferences and interviews with [ESA](http://www.esa.int/esaCP/) scientists over the weekend, there was clearly a discrepancy between what the  news media were expecting to see and learn and what the scientists could deliver so early on in the mission. One particular scientist  - [Martin G. Tomasko](http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/faculty/tomasko.html), principle  investigator for the descent imager - seemed to be showing the burden of expectation on him and his team to deliver detailed images of Titan straight away. 



	

Easing his burden, it seems that amateur descent imager investigators have started to process the raw image data themselves. [Anthony Liekens'](http://anthony.liekens.net/index.php/Main/Huygens) website contains many of his compositions showing Titan's surface in detail, as well contributions from other people. Some notable ones include:



	


	
  * [Colour 360 degree view from above Titan's surface](http://web.mit.edu/bitbucket/Titan/titan_panorama_colored.jpg)

		
  * [High altitude view looking straight down](http://web.mit.edu/bitbucket/Titan//bigmosaic.jpg) - I believe all of the composite images were taken using a single downward facing camera, and the reason they're in a circular arrangment is because Huygens was spinning during its descent.

The raw image data that both the amateur and ESA scientists are working with is available at an [Arizona State University homepage](http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~kholso/triplets1.htm).
