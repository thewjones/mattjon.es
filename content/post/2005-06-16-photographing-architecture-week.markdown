Over the course of National Architecture Week, I shall be taking  pictures of my favourite North East buildings and uploading them to Flickr using the tag "[architecture week](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattj/tags/architectureweek/)".



	

First off is the Engineering Research Station, a Grade II listed building in [Killingworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killingworth), a small town situated a few miles north of Newcastle and a treasure trove of [Brutalist style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalism) architecture. 



	

Designed by Newcastle based [Ryder & Yates](www.ryderhks.com) in the mid 60s, the building won numerous awards at the time. The Twentieth Century Society website has some good [information](http://www.c20society.org.uk/docs/building/killingworth.html) about the the ERS. More buildings - other than ones used for public transport - should be called 'stations', in my opinion.
