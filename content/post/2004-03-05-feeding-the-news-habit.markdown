title: Feeding the News Habit

Recently, I've been using Steve Minutillo's server side RSS / Atom aggregator [Feed on Feeds](http://minutillo.com/steve/feedonfeeds/) for all my news gathering needs. Having become used to using 3-pane desktop aggregators like [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) and more recently [Pears](http://project5.freezope.org/pears/index.html) (a cross-platform desktop aggregator written in Python), I assumed that browser based readers would offer a poorer user experience.  However, using Feed on Feeds, it's clear that the browser window is a great place to check your news subscriptions, mainly because you can access them from any web enabled device. Having your aggregator set up on a publicly accessible server does mean that it's open to abuse, so you do have password protect the folder it's sitting in, but limitations aside, it's a great piece of software. [This page](http://minutillo.com/steve/feedonfeeds/) has instructions on how to install Feed on Feeds as well as how to set up a Cron job to periodically check your subscriptions.
