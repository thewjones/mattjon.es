Everyone wins as a result of The Grey Album [download](http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html). The Beatles get the respect of a new audience of young music sharers and Danger Mouse and Jay-Z get large amounts of publicity. People **will** go out and buy their records as a result of this, unless they're crippled with Copy Protection or other DRM that is.
