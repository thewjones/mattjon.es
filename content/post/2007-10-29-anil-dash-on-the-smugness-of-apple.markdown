[Anil Dash on the smugness of Apple](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/10/smug-ugly.html)

When browsing your network in Leopard, machines running windows appear as beige monitors showing the Blue Screen of Death. Anil Dash takes issue with this:


<blockquote>The disdain here isn't for the unfortunate unwashed who have to suffer through Windows because they're so clueless -- it's a snide shot at the other computers you own, or of your family's other machines around the house, or of the computers of the peers you work with. In short, the derision is likely aimed at people who care a hell of a lot more about you and your boundless Mac-enhanced creativity than, say, the OS X team does.</blockquote>
