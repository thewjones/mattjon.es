_'The Dock is hated by Mac veterans, who see it as a jack-of-all trade replacement for the combination of switcher, Apple menu and control strip. It's hated by NeXT veterans, who see it as an equally inadequate replacement for NeXT's elegant Dock and Shelf combination. It's hated by newbies - who as one questioner so eloquently put it yesterday (hi Brett) - can't make out one damn fuzzy icon from the next on a fully loaded system.'_ - [Andrew Orlowski](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/24082.html).Brett, [here's a tip](http://frownland.com/index.shtml?archive/2001_11_01_archive.html#7528690).
