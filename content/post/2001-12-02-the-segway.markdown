The unveiling of Dean Kamen's revolutionary transport device is imminent. [This page](http://jedstar.com/ginger/) will post video footage of the event at some point tomorrow. A link was posted at [forum](http://www.37signals.com/svn/) on the web at the moment. Much of the discussion is based around this alleged [report](http://makeashorterlink.com/?W1582233) from the Associated Press which describes the device in greater detail. I have to say that the more I read it, the more it sounds like the next [Sinclair C5](http://www.sinclairc5.co.uk/). I guess we'll have to wait until tomorrow [Monday] for the truth behind all the hype.
