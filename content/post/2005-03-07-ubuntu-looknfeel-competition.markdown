title: Ubuntu Look'n'Feel Competition

Just over a month ago, I read that [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) were having a [competition](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/websitecompetition) to redesign their website. So, with a few ideas in my head about what it could look like, I set about producing a design for it. 



	

I'd done a bit with work with [Plone](http://plone.org/) - the content management system they're using - before, so I tried to keep many of the existing page elements the same to make adding the skin as easy as possible while sprucing the design up a bit in the process. 



	

I got an email from [Jeff Waugh](http://gnomedesktop.org/node/2158) this morning saying that they couldn't pick an outright winner, but mine was one of [three joint winning entries](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/webcomp2005winners), and they've decided to use elements of all three in the final design. I can't recall ever having entered a competition before - even the ones on the back [Rice Krispies boxes](http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=rice+krispies&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search) - so I'm rather pleased to be a winner in one.
