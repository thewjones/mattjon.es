title: Playing music
---

In 2020 I started making electronic music, mainly as a more creative way to unwind during lockdown evenings. 

It's mainly quite meditative stuff, inspired by the early pioneers of electronic music: Laurie Spiegel, Pauline Oliveros and also the early work of Steve Reich.These musicians either used tape loops or sequencers to experiment with melody, harmony and rhythm.

[My latest live piece](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1zqJVXVpyVLKB) used two step-sequencers (software the triggers a set of notes over a number of bars). Each sequencer was in a different odd time signature and they were pitched a fifth interval apart.

Both sequencers controlled a single synth. Then I controlled both the sequencer and the synth using the a single media keyboard contoller, improvising in C minor with delay and other effects.

I get the sense that for those early experimental musicians, making their music was about breaking compositional rules and about play and discovery with the new technology at the time.
