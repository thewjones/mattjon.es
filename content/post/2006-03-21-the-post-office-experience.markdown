Walk into a [Post Office](http://www.postoffice.co.uk) these days and you may find yourself walking out having not only posted a parcel, but also [signed up to a credit card](http://www.postoffice.co.uk/portal/po/jump2?catId=19400177&mediaId=21600438), switched to a [new telephone provider](http://www.postoffice.co.uk/portal/po/jump2?catId=19300215&mediaId=19300217) or [insured your home](http://www.postoffice.co.uk/portal/po/jump1?catId=19300223&mediaId=19300229).


	

As I was queueing in the Post Office last week, I overheard a conversation between a Post Office employee and an elderly customer:


	

<blockquote>
		
> 
> "You've been a Post Office user all your life, so you can trust if us you switch your home insurance to us."
> 
> 
	</blockquote>


	

So the Post Office are on the hard sell, the reason being the [Department for Work and Pension's](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/) decision to pay state benefits directly in people's bank accounts instead of using the Post Office's services, thus denting their yearly revenue significantly. 


	

Their Chief Executive put a positive spin on the move towards providing financial services [like this:](http://www.royalmailgroup.com/news/expandarticlea.asp?id=1283&brand=Post_Office_network)


	

<blockquote>
		
> 
> "Extensive research carried out among 20,000 customers clearly indicated a huge demand for financial services from a brand like the Post Office."
> 
> 
	</blockquote>


	

If there's such a demand, why do I always get told about the competitive interest rate on their Credit Card just as I've paid for a parcel to be delivered? One could argue it's either that or a significant rise in the cost of posting items; I think I'd rather pay a bit more than be hassled by their insistent sales patter.
