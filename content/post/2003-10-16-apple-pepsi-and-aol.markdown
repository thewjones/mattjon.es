Seems like Apple aren’t holding back in their promotion of the new version of [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) and the [Music Store](http://www.apple.com/music/store/) for Windows; they’re teaming up with both Pepsi and AOL to help sell music and iPods. This from the [Macrumors](http://www.macrumors.com) live updates from the Apple Music Event:


<blockquote>Bono says he appreciates what Apple’s done and that’s why he’s here to “kiss corporate ass. I don’t always kiss corporate ass”</blockquote>
