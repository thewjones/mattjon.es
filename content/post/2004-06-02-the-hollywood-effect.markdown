title: The Hollywood Effect

Hollywood likes to put relatively unknown but highly talented film makers in the director's chair for its big summer blockbusters. However, this results in some odd clashes of genre and style when reading director filmographies. For example, the [new Harry Potter film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304141/) has been directed by the Mexican film maker [Alfonso Cuaron](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0190859/), who directed [Y tu Mama Tambien](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245574/). I find this almost as bizarre as [Mike Hodges](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0388198/), after directing the Tyneside gangster epic [Get Carter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067128/) then going on to direct [Flash Gordon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080745/).
