One of the highlights of the classic American kids TV show [Sesame Street](http://www.sesameworkshop.org/) was, for me,  the [Pinball Song](http://members.tripod.com/Tiny_Dancer/pinball.html ); an animation sequence with perhaps the funkiest music you're ever likely to hear. The web is full of useless information and [Google](http://www.google.com/) hardly ever fails to come up with relevent results for even the most trivial of searches. But finding conclusive information on who recorded this song is almost impossible; search results appear more like a [Googlewhack](http://www.googlewhack.com/) attempt. I managed to glean some information from searching the [Usenet archives](http://groups.google.com/) in which it was suggested that the song was written by [Herbie Hancock](http://www.herbie-hancock.com/) and sung by the [Pointer Sisters](http://www.thepointersistersfans.com/), but no-one was really sure. So, with this information, I shall continue my quest for the truth behind the song and hopefully find a decent mp3 version of it.
