Jeppe Hein's [Modified Social Benches](https://www.jeppehein.net/pages/project_id.php?path=works&id=126) are a set of public benches installed on London's South Bank. Each one takes the design of a standard public bench and modifies it in playful and extreme ways, to the point where they often lose their function as places to sit.

Perhaps as objects for spontaneous play, they serve more people than they would if they were normal public benches.
