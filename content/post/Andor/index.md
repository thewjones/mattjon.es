A post about Andor, with no spoilers.

I don't tend to consume a lot of tv or films these days. It's not that I don't want to, it's a just a lack-of-time thing really. 

I will occassionally seek out new Star Trek series (see what I did there) and watch the various Star Wars series when they come out. 

I enjoyed the Mandalorian and Obi-Wan Kenobi, but couldn't stick with The Book of Boba Fett. So when I saw yet another Star Wars series available on Disney Plus I sort of thought '*not another series shoe-horned into the Star Wars saga*' and wasn't particularly compelled to check it out. 

Then I read up on it and saw that it was produced by the same team as Rogue One, which is widely considered to be the best of the post-prequel Star Wars films, to which I agree. You know when a film sticks in your mind for a bit after you've seen it? Well Rogue One is the only Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi that did that to me.   

So on that basis, I decided to watch Andor, and having watched it, I'd say it's up there with the best of the entire Star Wars franchise. It covers completely new ground with plotting and character development, it's about fundamental themes of oppression and resistance, it's visually stunning, it's surprising, it's tonally perfect with touches of humour in the right places, and it's obviously written and directed by people with a singular vision who can write a good plot.

I'm just going to leave it there and say watch it.
