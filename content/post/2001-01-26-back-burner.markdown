[subsist.org](http://www.subsist.org) [a site that has been on the back burner for a year and a half now] is going to be collaborative, jam packed with content, eXtensible [as soon I get my head round all this DOM, XML, CSS, PHP stuff) and anti-commercial. Over the last year or so, I've designed and re-designed almost to the point of completion and then given up. Version 1 of the design can be seen [here](http://www.subsist.org/version1/) [complete with usual DHTML scroller] and here are the beginnings of [version 2](http://www.subsist.org/version2) of the design [I was getting really ambitious with this one]. I soon realised the site was getting just too big for one person to manage… so I gave up and started doing this site instead [I also wanted to stop playing it safe with greyscale palettes and decided on this stupid yellow]. So… I'm in the the process of re-designing [subsist.org](http://www.subsist.org) yet again and this time I'm going to do something that is within my reach.
