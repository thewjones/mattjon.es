title: The freedom to offend in 140 characters

We cannot have a web on which a 140 character utterance of criticism against someone else causes a torrent of abuse against the offender and a front-page [BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8335793.stm) about the offendee's intention to quit because of it.

Yesterday, Twitter user [Brumplum](http://www.twitter.com/brumplum) criticised [Stephen Fry](http://www.twitter.com/stephenfry/) by calling his tweets boring, and Stephen Fry reacted by threatening to quit Twitter. We'll look back on this and see how silly it all is, and in future BBC editors with publish more important news.
