title: Bobby Womack Plays Guitar Upside-down

While watching the legendary [Bobby Womack](http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Bobby%20Womack.html) on last night's [Laterâ€¦ with Jools Holland](http://www.bbc.co.uk/later/), I was struck by the fact that he plays a right-handed guitar left-handed. [Jimi Hendrix](http://www.jimi-hendrix.com/) famously did this, but he re-strung his right-handed guitars so that the strings were in the right order. Bobby Womack leaves the strings just as they are, meaning that the chord shapes are upside-down and awkward to play and he has to strum upwards for the them to sound normal. Very odd, but I appreciate musicians who develop a unique style of playing in this way.
