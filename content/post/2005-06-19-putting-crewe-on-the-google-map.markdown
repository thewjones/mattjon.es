title: Putting Crewe on the Google Map

wordpress_id: 173

I'm trying to work out whether the fact that the UK version of [Google Maps](http://maps.google.co.uk/), by default, focuses on my town of birth - [Crewe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crewe) - is down to Google knowing information about me that I don't remember telling it, or just a coincidence. If the latter, then I suppose it's something else Crewe is known for, other than [Rolls Royce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce) cars, its [Railway Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crewe_station), and [Crewe Alexandra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crewe_Alexandra) football club. 



	

According to Wikipedia, there's a [crater on Mars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crewe_crater) named after Crewe, not sure what that says about the place.
