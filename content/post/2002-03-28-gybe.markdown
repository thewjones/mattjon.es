The first thing that strikes you when you go and see [Godspeed You Black Emperor!](http://www.brainwashed.com/godspeed/) live is that there is a heck of a [lot](http://www.brainwashed.com/godspeed/deadmetheney/images/misc/misc4.gif) of 'em - 9 in fact; 3 guitarists, a cellist, a violinist, 2 bass players and 2 drummers. Most of the material they played was from their latest album '[Lift Yr Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004ZBMO/026-7067541-9342010)' and the sounds rippled then swelled into a cacophonus wall of noise as each song followed a repetitive pattern of quiet then loUD! I enjoyed the gig but I wouldn't say I was massively entertained by it. I can't quite pin point why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I wouldâ€¦ they certainly made an incredible noise, but if there's 9 musicians on stage, there's always going to be an incredible noise made of some description.
