title: Transition to Textpattern

wordpress_id: 90
---

I've completed what I've been meaning to do for a few months, which is move this site over to [Textpattern](http://www.textpattern.com). 


	

The old system was a home-made solution using [PHP](http://www.php.net) and [Smarty](http://smarty.php.net), but while I got the front-end half way towards what I wanted it to be, the administration side was, admittedly, a mess; it just about did the job of maintaining the site, but not very well. 


	

In the near future, I'll probably write up the process I went through to get everything moved over from a home-brew system, and I'll also share some thoughts on Textpattern itself. 


	

In the meantime, it will be nice to write content using a feature rich and useable weblogging tool for a change!
