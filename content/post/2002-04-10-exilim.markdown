Casio have launched the [Exilim](http://www.casio.com/corporate/pressroom.cfm?act=2&pr=5530), another miniature digital camera to go alongside the ranks of the [L'espion](http://www.digitaldreamco.com/shop/espion_review.html). This one seems a bit more advanced though, features include an mp3 player and sound recording capability. [via [t-melt](http://www.t-melt.com/)]
