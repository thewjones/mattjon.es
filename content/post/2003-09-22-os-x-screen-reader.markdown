[Macrumors](http://www.macrumors.com) has posted a link to a [job vacancy](https://jobs.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Employment.woa/wa/jobDescription?RequisitionID=2017829) at Apple for a programmer to work on a Screen Reader for OS X. It’s clear that the software will be intended as a general screen reader for the Mac, but it will no doubt have features enabling web pages to be converted to speech as well.

As conscientious web developers, we’ve built sites to [W3C](http://www.w3c.org) recommendations, tinkered with CSS and structured (X)HTML logically, but a real understanding of how alternative web browsing software and devices operate has been difficult to attain. Finally, web developers using OS X may be able to find out what their pages sound like, and of course, the benefit of this software to blind and partially sighted Mac users will be immeasurable.
