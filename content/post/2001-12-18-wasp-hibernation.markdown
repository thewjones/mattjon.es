The announcement that the [Web Standards Project](http://www.webstandards.org/) is going to have a period of inactivity for a while has been met with a mixture of criticism and respect from the web design community. Maybe it was a result of [Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/)'s slightly ambiguous posting to the front page of webstandards.org, but there has been a definite over-reaction to this news. It's as if the WaSP is the life and soul of the move towards a standardised Web and without it, the Web will regress back into a mess of propriatory HTML tags and browser-centric standards. Undoubtedly, the project has done much to stop this from happening, and it has provided guidance to web designers on how to build sites that are compliant to [W3C standards](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/), interoperable and future-proof. The instructions are there, laid down in the archives of [webstandards.org](http://www.webstandards.org) and [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com), now it is up to developers to take the challenge and design sites that separate style from content and most importantly [validate](http://validator.w3.org/). After all, it is a **better** way to design. Having said that, it isn't easy; I spend half my time pulling my hair out trying to get my valid code working across so-called standards compliant web-browsers. Of course, I could bodge something together in [Dreamweaver](http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/) or [Flash](http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/) and be done with it, get it through the door. But no, I'd rather spend time getting it right, because there **is** a right way of doing it. Unfortunately, so many respectable [organisations](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk&amp;charset=%28detect+automatically%29&amp;doctype=Inline) and [companies](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com&amp;charset=%28detect+automatically%29&amp;doctype=%28detect+automatically%29) are still getting it wrong and this is what is holding back the standards compliant web. The WaSP's job is done; now it's time for XHTML, CSS and the ideals of interoperability to be embraced by a much larger community of designers.
