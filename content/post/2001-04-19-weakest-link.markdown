title: Weakest Link

So, 'The Weakest Link' is now [a big hit in the States](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/tv_and_radio/newsid_1285000/1285146.stm). It's difficult to comprehend that what started as a crappy no-budget BBC day-time quiz show can have such success not only in UK, but in America as well. This can only be bad news for terrestrial television viewers here in the UK; the BBC will further inflict us with dire quiz shows in the hope that they will follow in the footsteps of 'The Weakest Link'. Indeed, we've already seen the consequences in an equally rubbish show called 'Dog Eat Dog'. Then there's Anne Robinsons annoying catchphrase [I'm not even going to bother repeating it here] which can only infect our culture as horrendously as the 'wazzup' phrase. Is it any wonder that I hardly watch television any more?
