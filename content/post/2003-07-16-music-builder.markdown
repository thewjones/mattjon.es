[Music Builder](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/people/personal/barry/programs.html ) is a clever utility for OS X that scans your hard drive for MP3s and generates an HTML page of album covers. I found using Music Builder on my MP3 collection to be quite an enlightening experience, seeing as, admittedly, I don't own some of the albums displayed.
