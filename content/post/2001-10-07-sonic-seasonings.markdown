I can't stop buying original vinyl records at the moment. Yesterdays purchases:[Enter The Dragon OST](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Ahb861v7ozzpa) - The classic movie soundtrack composed by [Lalo Schifrin](http://www.schifrin.com/).[Django Reinhardt & Stephane Grappelli: The Quintet of the Hot Club of France](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Abvg9kemtjq7x): 1930's swing jazz guitar. I can definitely see myself collecting more music from this era, it's so uplifting. [Walter Carlos: Sonic Seasonings](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Ajmazefwk8gf5) - Walter Carlos [who decided to change his sex and call himself [Wendy](http://www.wendycarlos.com) in 1979] pioneered electronic music-making in the late sixties with her experiments with classical music using [Moog synthesizers](http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/moog/) [the ones that were the size of a small house]. Much of it sounds very dated now though; listen to the soundtrack of [A Clockwork Orange](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0066921) and you'll see what I mean. However, Carlos' best work was when she composed her own music like the haunting soundtrack for [The Shining](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0081505) and the album [Sonic Seasonings](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Ajmazefwk8gf5) eight years earlier. This double LP contains 4 tracks, each corresponding to the 4 seasons and is mainly field recordings with quiet electronic 'atmospheres' over the top. The last track, Winter - containing the voice of Rachel Elkind - is stunning.
