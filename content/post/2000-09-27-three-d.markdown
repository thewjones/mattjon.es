3D interface and video at [egoland](http://www.egoland.as). I enjoy innovative Flash sites and interface design, but even though [Flash](http://www.macromedia.com/flash) is becoming a standard, and now has good cross-platform compatibility, I think web designers are forgetting what the [World Wide Web](http://www.w3c.org) is. It is easy for a designer to become obsessed with jaw-dropping graphics and animation and forget that the web can be more than than a race to produce the flashiest piece of web design. I think that being 'online' is almost a sense, like you're connected to something that's constantly changing. Browsing through [k10k](http://www.k10k.com) whilst eating my lunch gives me this sense (ok.. so it's down at the moment), checking the latest news on the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk) site also gives me this sense. The majority of web sites (particularly ones which are purely generated by flash), don't - they may have loads of moving graphics but they are static in the sense that they never change. I will visit once, be impressed and forget about it. When they are updated, it is usually after they have been online for 6 months and it's time to revamp the whole site with the latest in cutting edge design. I really hope this isn't the future of the World Wide Web.
