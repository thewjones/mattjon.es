Engineers in South Korea have come up with a novel way to out-do [Honda](http://world.honda.com/ASIMO/), [Toyota](http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/special/robot/) and [Sony](http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/QRIO/) by producing a bipedal robot called [Albert Hubo](http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/photosalon/200511/kt2005111418021811530.htm), which, rather unnervingly, has Albert Einstein's noggin attached to it. All they need to do now is drop in a positronic Einstein brain and we have the world's most intelligent humanoid robot; they expect to do this sometime next week.
