title: Hyperlink to Napster

wordpress_id: 1459

Apparently, it is possible to create a hyperlink straight into a [Napster](http://www.napster.com) search (if you have Napster installed that is). I don't know how cross platform/browser compatible it is though. So far, I've only got it working on [IE5](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/ie/) for the [Mac](http://www.apple.com).
