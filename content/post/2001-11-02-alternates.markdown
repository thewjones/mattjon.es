I'm working on a new personal site using multiple stylesheets and I've been playing around with some [PHP](http://www.php.net) to dynamically swap the stylesheet depending on the user's preference. Just recently however, I've been stumped on how to create a cookie so that the browser remembers the preferred stylesheet [i'm not really a programmer y'see]. So what's the latest issue of AListApart? [Alternative Style](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/alternate/), a tutorial on successfully integrating what I've been trying to get my head around over the last few weeks. It even has a [downloadable](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/alternate/styleswitcher.js) javascript file that does it all for you. Hurray for [AListApart](http://www.alistapart.com)!
