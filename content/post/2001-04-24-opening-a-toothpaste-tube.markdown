title: Opening a Toothpaste Tube

wordpress_id: 1287

Is it something particular about males that makes us unable to open toothpaste tubes without the aid of a pair of scissors  or other pointed object? The reason I write this is because I [read this](http://baddesigns.com/tube.html) and realised that I had the exact same experience as this guy; I was trying to open the damn thing for about 5 minutes until my girlfriend quietly pointed out that there was a device on the top of cap for breaking the seal of the tube cleanly and efficiently. The time I could have saved if only I had this **valuable** piece of knowledge stored in my brain!
