![](/images/shropshireblue.jpg)If you've ever seen a Wallace & Gromit film, you'll know that we British like our Cheese, and that many localities of the British Isles are proud of their cheese heritage; Cheshire, Leicester, Wenselydale and Stilton to name but a few.





I grew up on the [border between Cheshire and Shropshire](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=nantwich&sll=54.162434,-3.647461&sspn=13.117946,30.761719&ie=UTF8&t=k&om=1&ll=53.514185,-2.416992&spn=13.320813,30.761719&z=5&iwloc=addr), so [Shropshire Blue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shropshire_Blue) cheese was regularly on my dinner plate. The locals like to think of it as their local version of the venerable [Stilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilton_%28cheese%29) - a cheese who's origin dates back to the early 18th century. Unfortunately for the locals, Shropshire Blue harbours a nasty secret: it was invented 1970s in [Inverness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness) and it's origin has nothing to do with Shropshire. Yes, it's the Marketeers who named it Shropshire Blue to make it more appealing to us English.





If you tell a Shropshire resident this piece of trivia, it's likely that they won't believe you, such is the power of Marketing to ingrain complete misconceptions into millions of people.
