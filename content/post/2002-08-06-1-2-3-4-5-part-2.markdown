You may remember [my quest](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/index.shtml?archive/2002_02_01_archive.html#9919624) to find out the truth behind Sesame Street's funk masterpiece 'The Pinball Song'. Well, thanks go to [Seth](http://www.geocities.com/noseworthykids/Seth/) for emailing me with some great information about it:



	

_'I have found (through ASCAP) that the author is listed as one Walt Kramer. The copyright is owned by Sesame Street, Inc. and licensing is handled through Sony/ATV Tunes. I'm still waiting for a reply from the Sesame Street music director re: more info on Walt and the song (which also may be known as J Imagination (Lower) or Sesame Street Cues.'_
