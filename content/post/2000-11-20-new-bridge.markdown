Just used my lunch hour to check out the '[Millennium Bridge](http://www.wilkinsoneyre.com/cwalsite/bridges/baltic.html)' currently being installed on the Tyne. They're floating it up river on a super-massive crane, apparently the largest one of its type in the world. Quite an impressive sight I can tell you.
