See (and sit on) Jeppe Hein’s witty reinventions of the park bench, each one different from the next. Hein’s series of Modified Social Benches are based on research into ‘personal space’ and inspired by New York benches.

Their design borrows from the familiar park or garden bench, altered to various degrees to make the act of sitting a conscious physical process and challenging the amount of space that people set between themselves and others.
