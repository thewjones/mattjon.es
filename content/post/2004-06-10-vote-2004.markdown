It was an [all-postal ballot](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3792445.stm) here in the North East. For me it might as well not have been; I left it right until the last minute and had to deliver by hand. There was a [Royal Mail](http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm) van parked up outside the town hall; the post men and women are having a busy time.
