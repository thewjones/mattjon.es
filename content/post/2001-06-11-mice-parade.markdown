If you like [Tortoise](http://www.brainwashed.com/tortoise/), you'll most definitely enjoy [Mokoondi](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005AQC9/o/qid=992284263/sr=8-1/026-7043585-6923667) by [Mice Parade](http://www.fat-cat.co.uk/artists/miceparade.html)... a very nice listen indeed. ::. In an attempt to improve my sense of well being [whatever that is], I'm making a concious effort to consume more fruit and vegetables and less junkâ€¦ speaking of which, since when did [Cadbury's](http://www.cadbury.co.uk) Boost bars cease to contain peanuts? I had my suspicions when I read this on the wrapper: "Warning, this product may contain traces of peanut"... eh? Further investigation led to my realisation that what I thought were peanuts were actually small pieces of biscuit made to look like peanuts. The worrying thing is that Boost bars still taste like peanuts, which is either a result of some kind of [pavlovian](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/bhpavl.html) conditioning, or they are putting nasty [E number](http://www.bryngollie.freeserve.co.uk/Enumbers.htm) flavourings in them. All this goes to show that I haven't got a clue what I'm eating half the time and I'm sure the same can be said for most of us.
