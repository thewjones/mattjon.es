This is [the winning animation](http://www.warprecords.com/goplastic/02.php?video=1) in [Warp's](http://www.warprecords.com) competition to create a video for a track from Squarepusher's latest album [Go Plastic](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005K3TH/o/qid=/sr=8-2/ref=sr_aps_pm_1_2/202-3476950-1059800)... very nice indeed. The videos for the 4 other finalists are excellent too.'How are forms of communication changing? How can architecture accommodate this evolution in communication?
