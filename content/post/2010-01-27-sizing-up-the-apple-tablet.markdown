title: Sizing up the Apple Tablet

I doubt the Apple Tablet will be much bigger than the iPhone hardware. In the past, tablet PCs running Windows have been large and expensive devices, which is not a good combination for a hand-held product.

My prediction is something bigger than an iPhone (and just as thin and sleek), but no bigger than a Kindle.
