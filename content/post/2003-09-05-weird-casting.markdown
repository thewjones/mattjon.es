Well I never thought I'd see [Steve Coogan](http://www.alan-partridge.co.uk/pictures/Alan006.jpg) and [Jackie Chan](http://home.enter.vg/cyc/jackie/splash.jpg) star alongside each other in a film. They are both in a remake of the Jules Verne classic,  [Around the World in 80 Days](http://aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=15976); Coogan as Phileas Fogg and Chan as Passepartout. 



	

The rest of [the cast](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327437/) is pretty incredible too: Jim Broadbent, _Arnold Schwarzenegger_, John Cleese, Kathy Bates and Owen and Luke Wilson.  



	

Do you think it might be a comedy?
