[News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3665661.stm) that the electrical goods retailer Dixons is to close 106 of its stores doesn't come as a surprise considering their reputation for being over-priced and having pushy salespeople who only pretend to know what they're talking about. [Their after-sale customer support isn't great either](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/05/20/never_ever_buy_anything/). A large scale downsizing it may be, but there are still 214 remaining stores to avoid.
