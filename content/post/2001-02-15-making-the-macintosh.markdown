Maybe the team at [Apple](http://www.apple.com) who are currently developing [Mac OSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) and new Apple products should have a good read of  '[Making the Macintosh](http://library.stanford.edu/mac/index.html)' - an exhaustive history of the Macintosh computer. I have a Mac [Classic II](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/stats/mac_classic_ii.html) stored in a cupboard at home and many a time I've felt like getting rid of my [iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/) and use my Classic II instead; it oozes simplicity, it hardly ever crashed, it just felt solid to use. I'm sure Apple have lost these attributes in their current mish-mash of products and that's presumably something to do with the Internet and its [browser](http://www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/stories/story/0,10738,2576415,00.html) and plugin wars.
