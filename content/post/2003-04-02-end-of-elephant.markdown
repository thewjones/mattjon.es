I'm assuming that's Meg White getting her stereotypes painfully mixed up with a shocking Australian / British accent at the end of The White Stripes [latest release](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=4:05:27%7CPM&sql=Ajzfoxq9aldje). It's a great album though; the duo continue to produce stripped down rock and roll that's sure to prompt a massive increase in sales of electric guitars and drum kits.
