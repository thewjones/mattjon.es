Thanks to James at [One Day Soon](http://www.infinitemonkeys.co.uk/onedaysoon/) for highlighting how various blogs [including [mine](http://www.infinitemonkeys.co.uk/onedaysoon/webTV/frownland.jpg)] render on the [WebTV](http://www.webtv.com) browser. I [downloaded](http://developer.webtv.net/design/tools/viewer/) the emulator the other day and I was expecting my site to be horribly mangled so it could be fit onto a PAL/NTSC resolution screen. Fortunately, the damage is pretty minimal; some of the table formatting is slightly messed up and the [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) defined table borders are missing but otherwise, it's OK.
