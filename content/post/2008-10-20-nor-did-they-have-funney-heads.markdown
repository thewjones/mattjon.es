Today, the Ministry of Defence published classified documents relating to UFO sightings in the UK between 1986 and 1992.

Those expecting high resolution photographs and detailed schematics of super-advanced alien tech may be disappointed to find thousands of poorly typed letters describing UFO sightings amounting to a stunningly feeble collection of evidence for extraterrestrial visitors.

There are also letters to the Prime Minister from distinguished organisations such as The Irish UFO Research Centre demanding that the UK Government release all the information they have on the program of 'genetic cross breading[sic]... with potentially hostile "Greys"'.

The files can be downloaded as [PDF documents from the National Archive website](http://ufos.nationalarchives.gov.uk/).
