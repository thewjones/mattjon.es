[BBC apologises over Queen clips](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6294472.stm)





So the BBC runs with a story in many of the morning's papers about the Queen storming out of a photo shoot by [Annie Leibovitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Leibovitz). Then they issue an apology to both the Queen and Leibovitz for misrepresenting the incident. But hang on... isn't this a BBC commissioned documentary?
