[Siteswap Design](http://www.siteswap.co.uk) is my new business oriented site. I designed the site earlier in the year, but it's only now that I can put my resources into launching it.  



	

If the weblog looks familiar, it's using the same database as Helium-3. This is only a temporary arrangement as I make improvements to the code over the next few days.



	

[Siteswap notation](http://www.juggling.org/help/siteswap/) is a way of describing complex juggling patterns. Not that I can do any of them but I thought it had a nice ring to it.
