Or wherever my travels take me. 



	

I bought a digital camera a few weeks ago; the first time I've bought one that doesn't sacrifice image quality for sheer novelty factor. It's a refurbished [Digital IXUS II](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canonsd100/) from the [Canon Outlet Store](http://stores.ebay.co.uk/Canon-Outlet) on [eBay](http://www.ebay.co.uk) (highly recommended if you're after a bargain digital compact).



	

So with a new means of taking pictures and a returned interest in photography (after having studied the subject for three years!), I've resurrected [frownland.com](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com) to be a photo log (heavily inspired by Heather Champ and [hchamp.com](http://www.hchamp.com))



	

I decided to use [Folderblog](http://folderblog.tetto.org/) to power it, for the ease with which it can be set up and the fact that it doesn't use [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) which my web server seems to struggle with just slightly. I had to hack it a bit to provide user friendly URLs and I'm still working on getting the template right. Also, I may add an RSS/Atom feed if I get round to it.
