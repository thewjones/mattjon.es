title: Jacking It All In

Do you ever feel like jacking it all in and going off to live on some small island off the Shetland mainland [or somewhere similar];... to ditch the digitopia we now live in and live life simply and within your own means. Y'see, I'm a bit of an 'armchair supporter' of this anti-capitalist thing now happening in London and other parts of the world. I'm sick of being hearded around, being told what to buy and when to buy it; and worse, I'm sick of being gullible enough to be sucked in by it all. Ho hum.
