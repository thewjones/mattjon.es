I bought a new old car a while ago: a [Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget 99](http://www.saab.co.uk/home/GB/en/historical_1976.xml). Saab's have a weird uniqueness to them which makes you feel like you're in a plane; which is no surprise considering they make planes [hence the 'aeroplan' bit]. In fact, my car is about as heavy as a plane, which would account for its thirst for fuel. Here's some [Saab history](http://www.saab.co.uk/home/GB/en/historical_1937.xml); my favourite is the [Saab 92001](http://www.saab.co.uk/home/GB/en/historical_1947.xml), the prototype for their first production model.
