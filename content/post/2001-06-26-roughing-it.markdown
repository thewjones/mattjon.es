title: Roughing It

Three days and nights roughing it at the weekend was exactly what I needed to snap me out of an long spell of feeling slightly under par.  Friday night was spent camping on the beach in Embleton [one of the many coastal towns on the northeast coast]. As we sat round the campfire, we watched the sunset, the stars [some of them of the shooting variety], the tide rolling in and finally, a few hours later, the sun rise above the  horizon. The second night was spent at a party in a forest clearing just outside Jedburgh in Scotland - there was music, a huge fire and rather bizarrely a hog roast [not something a vegetarian should witness]. On the third and final night, we went back to the coast [just north of where we were on the first night] and chilled out under the stars again. It was a great trip and exactly what I needed.
