Currently downloading [Johnny Jones and the King Casuals](http://le-village.ifrance.com/routedublues/Utrecht/jones.html)' version of Purple Haze from [Napster](http://www.napster.com). It's a belter. Of course, having sampled this, I now intend to **purchase** some of their stuff.   

   

[Shirley Bassey](http://www.geocities.com/~sbwebmaster/)'s version of [Light My Fire](http://www.insinet.it/music/doors6.htm) is also a must.
