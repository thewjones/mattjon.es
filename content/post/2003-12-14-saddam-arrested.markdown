I had to blink and rub my eyes when I looked at the news this morning; [Saddam has been captured](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3317429.stm). <del>Apparently, he was hiding in a cellar wearing a false beard; I've got visions of a Scooby-Doo style unmasking… '_and I would have got away with it… blah blah blah_'.</del>. Update: Well the cellar was, in fact, an eight foot deep hole in the ground and the beard was very much real.
