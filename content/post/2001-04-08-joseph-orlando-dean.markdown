[Here is a picture](http://www.otherworld.demon.co.uk/zero-one/images/dean5.jpg) my great grandfather took of himself alongside his treasured motorbike circa 1901. Note the use of the scenic backdrop to give a sense of depth and it's unfortunate mis-alignment in the composition. This may seem like a silly mistake to make until you consider that the picture was taken by himself with a camera with no clear and easy-to-use viewfinder to compose the picture. Quirks like this provide further evidence about the context in which the image was taken and give extra dimension to the picture; such is the power of the photographic image and its role in telling us about our history.
