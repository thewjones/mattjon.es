I felt it was about time I started writing more again, so, not particularly happy with the old design, I've given helium3 a new look. 



	

The latest day's content appears above the dotted line and the layout changes depending on what's been posted; links are displayed horizontally unless an article has been added at which point they're put in the right hand column.



	

The seven previous posts are displayed below the dotted line with articles on the left and links on the right. If few of those seven posts are articles, then an odd looking gap appears, giving me incentive to write longer posts!



	

I feel very rusty with my writing at the moment, so bear with me while I get back into the swing of things.
