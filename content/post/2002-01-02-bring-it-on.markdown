So why are we so afraid of the [Euro](http://europa.eu.int/euro/html/entry.html)? 'I want the Queen's head printed on my currency thank you very much!' says the vox populi, worrying that we'll somehow lose our sense of national identity if we enter the [European Monetary Union](http://amue.lf.net/). I'm sure the French will still be proud to be French, the Irish will still be proud to be Irish and so on; the fact that they share the same currency does nothing destroy their national heritage. I think the introduction of the Euro is very much a humanitarian event; bringing people together and looking to the future. Frankly, I'm embarrassed that my country hasn't taken part in it. It's inevitable that we will have to join the E.M.U. at some point in future, so it might as well be now.
