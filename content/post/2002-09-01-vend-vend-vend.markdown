_'It just appeared one day. This big ugly silver box plopped down on this concrete slab.'_



	

No-one can plop ugly metal boxes down on concrete slabs better than McDonalds Corp. At the moment, they claim that the [TikTok Easy Shop](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13689-2002Aug29.html) is just in its test phase, but it's a certainty that these things are going to be appearing everywhere;  there'll be mile-long queues for the one on [Pushkin Square](http://www.mcdonalds.com/countries/russia/russia.html), Moscow.
