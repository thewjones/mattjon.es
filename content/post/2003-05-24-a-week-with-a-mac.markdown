title: A Week with a Mac

Steven Garrity has [written up his experiences](http://www.actsofvolition.com/archives/2003/april/awindowsuser) of spending a week using a Mac as a long time Windows user. Apart from the 'hockey puck' mouse which was consigned to the desk drawer even before my Mac was prised from its polystyrene packaging, his set up of a Graphite iMac 400MHz running [Jaguar](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) is exactly the same as mine. This model is probably the lowest specced Mac you could get away with running Jaguar on and I'm pleased to say, four years after I bought it, it's doing a pretty good job. Applications such as Photoshop are a little sluggish but for web browsing and web developing (which are my main uses for my Mac), there's still life in the old gum-drop yet.
