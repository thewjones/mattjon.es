Inspired by Phil at [xlab](http://www.xlab.co.uk), I've added yet another section to the sidebar. [Kung-Tunes](http://www.versiontracker.com/moreinfo.fcgi?id=14694&db=mac) is an OS X utility working in combination with a PHP script that uploads live information about the track I'm currently playing on [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/).
