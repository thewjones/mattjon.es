So here it is, the all new design. I've spent the last few weeks trying add content and it wasn't working out at all, it was like to trying fit an awkward piece into an even more awkward jigsaw puzzle. So instead, I decided to strip it all down and re-arrange the content across more html files. I don't really have that much time on my hands to maintain content other than this blog, so I thought this route was the best one to take. As always, there is still more to do, like get the archives up and running and get the 'co-lab' section online. Anyway, I think it's an improvement.
