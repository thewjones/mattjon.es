In 1998, I did some experimentation with [SoundEdit 16](http://www.sfu.ca/sca/Manuals/147/SoundEdit16/SoundEdit16.html) to make some glitchy audio pieces. Well I call it experimentation, it was more like messing around with the software's audio filters to make as horrible a noise as I possibly could. 



	

I recorded the results to Minidisc and that's where they stayed until I recently copied them to my computer and [uploaded them](http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/usersViewSingle.php?id=5822) to The Freesound Project - a community driven database of sounds licensed under the Creative Commons. Maybe someone will find a use for them.
