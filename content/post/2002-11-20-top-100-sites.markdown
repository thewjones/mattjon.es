According to the Google [weblog](http://google.blogspace.com), simply by searching for '[http](http://www.google.com/search?num=100&q=http)' will return almost 260 million web sites listed in order of [PageRank](http://www.google.com/webmasters/4.html). No prizes for guessing what the top two results are. I suppose if you were looking for information about 'http', you'd be in trouble.
