It will be interesting to see some figures for [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) sales in the first few months of their release in the UK. I spend two and a half hours a day commuting, and I haven't seen one iPhone in use. iPod Touch sales will be strong in the run up to Yule, but the startling gap between the quality of the iPhone UI that of its competitors doesn't seem enough to lure us Brits away from our free phones and and choice of reasonable contracts.
