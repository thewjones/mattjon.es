Bruce 'Tog' Tognazzini [One of the designers of the original Mac OS] really does **not** like the '[the dock](http://www.asktog.com/columns/044top10docksucks.html)' on Mac OSX. Not a good sign. [addendum - reading [this](http://www.liquid.org/dock/) has made me realise that [Apple](http://www.apple.com) have completely lost it]  

   

More useability meanderings [current job](http://www.createonline.co.uk/c-issue.asp<br />
”>here</a>.<br />
 <br />
other news: 4 days of my <a href=) left… too much to do.
