If you're a [MacOSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) user, I recommend that you browse with  [Mozilla 0.9.1](http://www.mozilla.org/releases/). It looks just like the dreaded [Netscape 4.x](http://www.netscape.com) but don't let that put you off. In my opinion, it's the fastest and most standards compliant browser for OSX.
