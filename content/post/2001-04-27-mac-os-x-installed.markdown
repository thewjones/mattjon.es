title: Mac OS X Installed

I've just installed [Mac OSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) on my machine at work and it's the first time I've had a chance to get my teeth into it. It's very slick indeed, but I just can't make myself like the dock at all. What's confusing me is that it contains open applications and documents [like the bar in Windows] as well as containing _aliases_ to applications.  I find it confusing that there is little distinction between the two, except the small arrow beneath that indicates the application is open. The first thing I did when I set up my machine was to remove the aliases from the dock and put them on the desktop where I'm used to them [effectively making the dock merely into an open application switcher]. OK, so maybe I'm not giving it a chance, but I see this as a gradual way of making the transition to this new OS.
