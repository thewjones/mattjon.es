_"Science is not a heartless pursuit of objective information. It is a creative human activity, its geniuses acting more as artists than as information processors"_I can't say I've read any of [Stephen Jay Gould's](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1999000/1999341.stm) work, but I think I should.
