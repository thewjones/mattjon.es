The major Search Engines together with Weblog tool developers have  developed a simple way of deterring comment spammers. Simply by adding the attribute _rel="nofollow"_ will stop Search Engine Bots from following the link, thus denying spammers the [PageRank](http://www.google.com/technology/) gained from being linked. The Google Weblog has [an entry](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html) with more information about it.
