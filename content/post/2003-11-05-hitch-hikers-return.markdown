As I've already noted in the linklog, the original cast of the Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Series are [re-uniting ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2003/11/04/7768.shtml) to make two new series based on the books 'Life, the Universe and Everything', 'So Long and Thanks for all The Fish' and 'Mostly Harmless'. This is great news if, like me, you grew up reading, watching and listening to the Hitch-hiker's series. 



	

The first two novels, 'Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy' and 'Restaurant at the End of the Universe' were based on the original radio series, whereas now they're making radio series based on the final three novels. It will be interesting to see how this turns out as Douglas Adams admitted that he was kind of running out of ideas by the time he wrote 'So Longâ€¦'. Still, I'm looking forward to hearing the original cast perform again, albeit without Peter Jones as the voice of The Book.
