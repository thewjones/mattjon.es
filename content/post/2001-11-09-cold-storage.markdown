The [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/) is a huge archive of websites that are frozen in time; simply type in the URL of your favourite site and see how it looked in ancient times, like 3 years ago. Here is this site as it appeared in December [last year](http://web.archive.org/web/20001206210200/http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/). Incredibly, there's an archive of my very [first site](http://web.archive.org/web/19981202060137ws_18/www.otherworld.demon.co.uk/matt/index1.html ), made in December 1997. Go onâ€¦ have a laugh.
