title: Thanks Sajax

wordpress_id: 197
---

I thought I'd better get myself up to speed with [Sajax](http://www.modernmethod.com/sajax/), the web application toolkit based on [Ajax](http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php), which in turn is the set of web technologies packaged and promoted by [Adaptive Path](http://www.adaptivepath.com). 



	

This has already [been done](http://www.notbbc.net/lookaroundyou/) by the folks at [NotBBC](http://www.notbbc.net), but I thought I'd do a version myself using Sajax. Introducing the [Look Around You Thanks Generator](http://siteswap.co.uk/fun/thants/).



	

Apologies to those of you who have not seen the [programme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/lookaroundyou/), this is bound to deeply confuse you.
