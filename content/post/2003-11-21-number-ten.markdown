Well that was more difficult than I thought it was going to be. I ended up having an unexpectedly busy afternoon with arguably more important things to sort out. Still, I got there in the end, and I definitely feel inclined to write more regularly now. Thanks for reading and thanks to [Steve](http://www.steve.mallam.dsl.pipex.com/) and [Ash](http://www.incredible.org.uk) for taking part. Same time next year?
