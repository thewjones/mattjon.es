title: New OS X Browser

wordpress_id: 1013

OS X users have a new [Gecko](http://www.netscape.com/browsers/future/gecko.html) based web browser to play with, [Chimera](http://chimera.mozdev.org/installation.html) is a hefty download compared to the likes of [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), but once loaded the user is presented with a very simple, fast browser with a unique tab interface at the top. It's still a bit buggy, but I'm definitely going to stick with this browser to see how it develops.
