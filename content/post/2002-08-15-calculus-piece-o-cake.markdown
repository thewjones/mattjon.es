title: Calculus? Piece O' Cake.

Every year, the number of [A-level passes increases](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2194558.stm) and every year [A-Levels are criticised](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2188632.stm) for becoming too easy. If exams are becoming easier, then we can expect the average A-Level question to be along the lines of 'spell your name' in about 20 years time, right? I put this criticism down to one thing: that adults can't cope with the fact that kids are getting smarter.  

**Update:** [Boy wonder passes computing A-level](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2194966.stm)
