Thanks to [Timo](http://www.elasticspace.com/) for [this link](http://freespace.virgin.net/robert.bradfilms/hrm.html) regarding his friend Robert Bradbrook's film about his family's Peugeut 404 [re: [earlier post](http://frownland.com/index.shtml?archive/2001_03_01_archive.html#2941139)]. They don't make cars like they used to y'know.
