title: If Blogs were Novels

Over the last three years, I've spent a substantial amount of time writing and maintaining this weblog. Aside from the hours spent fiddling with [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) templates, [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), and the PHP code that I now use to maintain the site, I've written a large number of words. Now if only I'd selected these words more carefully and strung them together to make a story, I'd have written a good sized novel by now! Shucks.



	

To demonstrate this fully, I've cobbled together a script that counts the number of words in a weblog and compares the returned figure with the word count of some famous novels. If you would like to try it, the script requires [PHP](http://www.php.net) to be running on your server and your weblog to be stored in a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) database.



	


	
  * Download [blognovels.zip (1.6K)](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/stuff/blognovels.zip)

		
  * Modify blognovels.php with your MySQL details

		
  * FTP to your server. 

	

	

[Here's the script in action](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/stuff/blognovels.php). As you can see, I've sailed past The Wizard of Oz, The Thirty-nine Steps, The Jungle Book and Black Beauty and I'm now hot the heels of Gulliver's Travels!
