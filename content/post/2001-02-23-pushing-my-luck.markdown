title: Pushing my Luck

Dammit… I knew I was pushing my luck with [IE5/Win](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm) and that graphic to the left. For those of you using IE5.0, you'll notice that this image has gone a bit awry. This is because I decided to put a drop shadow on the image and the only way to blend it in was to incorporate some of the table formatting in the bitmap itself. Of course, if [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) bothered to implement [png](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/) compatibility into IE5.x/Win, I wouldn't have this problem; I'd just create an image with partial transparency in [Fireworks](http://www.macromedia.com/fireworks/), save it as a 32bit png file and Bob's your uncle. I might just do it anyway and suggest that people on a PC use [Netscape 6](http://home.netscape.com/download/) instead. It also looks as though IE5/Win is resizing the table cells on the left even though I have told it not to. Hmmmm. Bare with me while I iron out the flaws… normal service will resume soon.
