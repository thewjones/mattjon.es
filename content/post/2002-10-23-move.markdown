I'd forgotten how much of a headache moving house is. Three years at the same place has allowed me to accumulate more junk than I know what to do with. Multiple van loads later, most of our stuff has now been transported to our new abode; a place by the sea to be more precise and I fully intend on a fitness regime of a sea-front jog every morning. This, of course, will never happen.
