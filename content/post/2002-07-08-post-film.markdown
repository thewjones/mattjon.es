I thought [Minority Report](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0181689) made for good Saturday afternoon entertainment, but it didn't really meet my expectations. Spielberg did a decent job of representing [Philip K. Dick's](http://www.philipkdick.com/) strange vision of the future onto the big screen, but yet again, he makes you leave the cinema with the film wrapped up for you and finished off with a nice ribbon. I want to leave the cinema with my head saturated with the film; I want something to chew on, something that zonks my brain for a while as I walk home. Instead, my walk was spent thinking about the washing-up and the fact that I've never left a Spielberg film fully satisfied. The film gripped me until it turned into [The Fugitive](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0106977); from there it had its ups and downs including some classic Spielberg silliness - pre-crime might happen, but human glazzies will **never** roll along like ping pong balls. Of course, I liked the cinematography and the acting was good, but I think Spielberg could have made a more intelligent film with the material he had. 



	

If you liked Minority Report and you want to read some books by Philip K. Dick, then [The World Jones Made](http://www.philipkdick.com/jones.htm) is a good introduction. It contains many of the themes from Minority Report, including a pre-cog called Jones who constantly sees one year into future. I wish I could do that.
