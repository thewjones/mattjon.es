A few days ago, I posted an entry about a spamming incident on the [Rhizome](http://www.rhizome.org) list. Here's what its creator has to say about it [mailed to the list a few minutes ago]:  

   

  

  

" >> SHUT UP SPAM MAN  

   

  

  

In this case, the man was a PHP script which sends an email  

when a 404 error occur in x-arn.org website. The file that  

contains the broken link is read by the script, and its URL  

is linked in the email. So, in fact, the so-called spam is  

the result of a global activity in the net, reflecting the  

kind of disorganisation inherent to updating process, file  

moving and renaming, as a network movement origin. "
