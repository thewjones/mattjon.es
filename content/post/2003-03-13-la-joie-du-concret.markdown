Phillipe Petit, the tightrope walker who famously [skywalked between the Twin Towers in 1974](http://commemoratewtc.com/history/facts/petit.php) is planning a similar feat to take place somewhere in Gateshead. Now, the only culturally significant piece of architecture on which such a stunt is worthy to be performed is [The Car Park](http://www.rmaz.co.uk/ghm.html), but I'm having trouble thinking of another tall structure nearby to which the tightrope can stretch; it's a long way to the [Dunston Rocket](http://mysite.freeserve.com/owenluder/page5.html).
