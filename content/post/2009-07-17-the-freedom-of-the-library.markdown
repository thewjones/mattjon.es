![Library Chair](http://local.wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cnv00035-300x200.jpg)[Newcastle City Library](http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/core.nsf/a/librariesnewcitylibrary) isn't really just a library; it is a cultural venue as significant to the city than the flagship venues of [The Sage](http://www.sagegateshead.co.uk/) and [BALTIC](http://www.balticmill.com). There's an openness to the place, from the glass exterior, to the open plan interior, and to the fact it's completely self-service.

Initially, the library was [accused](http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/06/16/newcastle-city-library-accused-over-security-72703-23887948/) of an 'appalling lack of security' for not requiring identification when registering for the service. I congratulate the Library on showing a level of trust which otherwise seems to be rare in our civic spaces.

I use the library quite regularly during the week, as a place to work, drink coffee and read the papers. If you haven't been yet, go. It's marvellous.
