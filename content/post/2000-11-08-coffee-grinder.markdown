Bought one of [these](http://www.grimesco.ie/departments/kitchen/grinder.htm) beauties the other day (for only a tenner. bargain). I didn't realise that grinding the coffee before each mug makes a whole heap of difference. There's nothing better than [Old Brown Java](http://www.hollandcoffee.com/indonesia.htm), with loads of hot milk (latte style) and a smidgen of sugar. marvelous.
