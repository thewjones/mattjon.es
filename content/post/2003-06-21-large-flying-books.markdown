I picked up (as in 'picked up' and not 'bought') a copy of the new [Harry Potter book](http://www.bloomsburymagazine.com/BookCatalog/subject.asp?Category_id=28) whilst browsing round [Woolworths](http://www.woolworths.co.uk/) this afternoon. It took me a while to get my hands on it because just as my hand approached, the book would just fly off the shelf leaving me grasping at air. Having finally caught one, I must say, it is a weighty tome.
