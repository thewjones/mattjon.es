There's something very wrong about [projection keyboards](http://www.alpern.org/weblog/stories/2003/01/09/projectionKeyboards.html); emulating a device that should have been superceded by cooler input devices years ago seems like a bad use of clever technology to me. 



	

However, later on in the document, it suggests other possible applications of this technology, these include: _'projection notepads that track any pen, pencil or pen-like object; gestural interfaces for devices with inconvenient or ultra-small form-factors or locations (ie-wearable computers); and user identification and authentication through facial recognition'_. Now that's more like it.
