The Register has published [a list](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/27777.html) of banks whose web developers seem to have missed about 4 years of advancement in web browser technology. I bank with [Natwest](http://www.natwest.com) and would like to use their online banking service from home on my Mac running OS X. When I attempt to log in, I'm told that I have to use Netscape 4.x in order to access the site. It's unfortunate that the complex programming involved in making Natwest Online Banking secure requires it to be only accessible using very specific browsers; in this case, browsers that are now defunct on the Mac platform. I say, if you can't make an online banking service accessible to all web users then don't bother in the first place.
