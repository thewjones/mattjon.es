Being a fan of the work of [Paul Auster](http://www.paulauster.co.uk/) [author of [The New York Trilogy](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571152236/o/qid=979843678/sr=8-1/202-2979811-9113401), [Leviathan](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571169457/o/qid=979843752/sr=2-4/202-2979811-9113401) etc.], I was chuffed to discover that he has directed a film called '[Lulu On The Bridge](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0125879)'. I waited patiently for the film to appear somewhere [either on the cinema screens or 'straight to video'] only to discover that no-one was willing to distribute it [at least in the UK anyway]. This was probably because either a) It doesn't have the mass appeal of mainstream pap or b) It was generally a bad film. Either way, I would like to see it on the strength of [Smoke](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0114478) / [Blue In The Face](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0112541) [two films which he wrote/co-directed with [Wayne Wang](http://uk.imdb.com/Name?Wang,+Wayne)]. At last, it looks as though something is happening, and as my good friend Stu [who originally got me into Auster's writing] reports, a trailer can be found [here](http://www.videopipeline.net/Sponsor/s.asp?CMD=3&PUBLISHEDID=8393&CUSTOMERID=1&VpiSrcSite=1). [Let me know](mailto:matt@frownland.com) if you have seen this film and what you thought of it.
