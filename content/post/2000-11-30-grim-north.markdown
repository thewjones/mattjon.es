Up here in the grim north, it’s fair to say that us creative types are starved of things to inspire and lift us. So what **have** we got? Well, there’s the [Angel of North](http://www.kenfinn.demon.co.uk/angel/angel.htm) and the new [Millennium Bridge](http://www.gateshead-quays.com/secondpagebridgehtm.htm), but we’re pretty over saturated with large and interesting metal objects dominating the skyline as it is. What’s missing is any kind of new media art/design community, a sense of things happening and moving forward. For the time being, I’m determined not to succumb to the appeal of the [big city](http://www.london.com), the money, the lights, the fumes and try – in some small way – to change a few attitudes up here. [Newcastle](http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/) is a weird but unique place – it’s a city cut off from the urban sprawl of [Manchester](http://www.manchester.gov.uk/) and [Leeds](http://www.leeds.gov.uk/), and the cultural marvels of [Edinburgh](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/) and [Glasgow](http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/). Instead, it is surrounded by moorland and coastline and not much else other than [Sunderland](http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/) (which – apart from having some exceedingly bad architecture from 60s urban renewal – tends to have some pretty cool [stuff](http://www.ngca.co.uk/) happening). Things are changing though, and I think I’m going to be here for a little while longer before the lure of the [capital](http://www.london.com) (and the opportunities within it) wins me over.
