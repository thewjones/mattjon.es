The product [code-named 'Ginger' ](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-4424716.html?tag=st.ne.1007.thed.ni) will be an alternative to products that "are dirty, expensive, sometimes dangerous and often frustrating, especially for people in the cities."  Maybe it's an ultra-sleek titanium  [Sinclair C5](http://www.sinclairc5.co.uk/) with an 'in-car' 15.2 inch flatscreen LCD monitor, Internet access and slot loading DVD burner.
