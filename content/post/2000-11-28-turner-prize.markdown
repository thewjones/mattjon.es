[Turner Prize](http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerprize.htm) = [Controversy](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_1044000/1044375.stm). It's almost as if the panel (or whoever decides the shortlist) sits round and says "_Whoa! Hang on, we haven't selected a controversial artist yet. Oh look at this bloke, he paints huge copies of 1970s Sci-fi book covers… he'll do_." I suppose last year's prize was a rare occurence because the controversial nominee - [Tracy Emin](http://www.bway.net/~modcult/emin.html) - didn't win it. But hang on, [Steve McQueen](http://www.oasinet.com/postmedia/untitled/mcqueen.htm) copied [Buster Keaton](http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Studio/4083/general6.jpg) didn't he?. What a pretentious and fickle world the modern art scene is.

My [Mac](http://www.apple.com) at work decided to stop working yesterday… I've spent most of the morning trying to re-install the system software but to no avail. Macs - it's a love/hate relationship.
