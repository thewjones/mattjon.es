I've noticed a worrying trend in bad puns created by replacing the word 'dogs' with 'blogs'. This weeks [Spiked Online](http://www.spiked-online.com) seminar was called ['Gone to the Blogs'](http://www.samizdata.net/blog/archives/004551.html#004551), now Biz Stone <del>intends to title his next book</del> has given his next book the working title of ['Who Let the Blogs Out?'](http://www.bizstone.com/archive/2003_09_01_archive.htm#106393330945815678). Future titles for blog related seminars and books could include:



	


	
  * Blog eat Blog

		
  * Let Sleeping Blogs Lie
