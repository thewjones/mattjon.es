title: Hen's Meat

When I was a knee-high tike, I had a habit of mishearing and therefore misunderstanding certain phrases said by grown-ups around me. For example 'chest of drawers' became 'Chester Drawers', i.e, drawers made in the [City of Chester](http://www.cityofchester.org/). When someone, having a hard time getting a grip on things, said 'I'm really struggling to make ends meet', I always heard that as 'I'm really struggling to make hen's meat', to which I thought, _why don't you simply go out and buy some chicken_? Kids eh?
