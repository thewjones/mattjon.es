[Medeski, Martin and Wood: The Dropper](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004ZDM5/026-0515500-5862055) and [Cat Power: Dear Sir](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000035X73/026-0515500-5862055).

Boycott [HMV](http://www.hmv.co.uk) because their CDs cost 5 or 6 quid more than [other places](http://www.spincds.com). They regularly have 'bargain bin'  style sales just you get you through the door - I hate it when companies use ploys (like the way sweets are always positioned near the till queue in supermarkets, exploiting our lack of willpower when comes to buying junk food). There has definitely been an increase in this kind of activity in the last few years and it annoys me.
