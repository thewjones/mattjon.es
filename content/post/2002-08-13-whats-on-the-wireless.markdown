[Plink](http://www.subsist.org/plink/) is now available as a WAP site. I thought this might be useful to those who, like me:


	

a) Go into a record shop and forget what they went in for.  

b) Go into a record shop with the intention of leaving with something but are unsure what exactly.


	

So, introducing [Plink Wap](http://www.subsist.org/plink/wap/) [these names are getting sillier aren't they?]; enter the following address into your WAP browser and bookmark it: [http://www.subsist.org/plink/wap/](http://www.subsist.org/plink/wap/)
