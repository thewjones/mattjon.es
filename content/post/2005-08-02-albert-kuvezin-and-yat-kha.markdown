According to the Guardian, [Albert Kuvezin](http://www.stgeorgesbristol.co.uk/georges.dll?jump=935) has such a deep voice that "He makes Barry White sound like Jimmy Somerville â€¦". It's true, and you can hear his remarkable throat singing techique on Monday's [Late Junction](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/latejunction/index.shtml) (until 8/8/2005). His latest album is a collection of cover versions, which, like many other recent cover albums, contains songs by Kraftwerk and Joy Division.



	

Update: You may want to stay tuned to Monday's Late Junction for a cracking version of Led Zep's Whole Lotta Love by The Cato Salsa Experience and The Thing.
