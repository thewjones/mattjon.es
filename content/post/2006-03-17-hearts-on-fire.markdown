In 1990, [New Order](http://www.neworderonline.com/) made a record with the England football team to raise morale and generally support the team in their bid to win the World Cup tournament of that year. It was a pretty good record, and made memorable by John Barnes attempt at rapping halfway through. 


	

This song, however, pales into insignificance compared to the video you're about to see, in which Swedish metal band 'Hammerfall' got together with the national women's Curling team to make a record ahead of the Winter Olympics: [Hammerfall - Hearts On Fire](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4598147228689285645&q=hammerfall)


	

Well it worked, they won Gold.
