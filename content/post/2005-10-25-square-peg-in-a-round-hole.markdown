It seems like much has happened since back when I used to write more regularly. Then, I would write about new Web related happenings with interest. Now, things pass by and I can't seem to generate enough enthusiasm to gather my thoughts and write about them. I've started so many little projects to entertain myself on rainy weekends I've lost count. One of them has involved trying get all my posts and all your comments into Textpattern [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) tables so I don't have to contend with my clunky home-brew blogging system anymore. This is proving to be rather difficult for some reason, but I'm sure I'll manage it at some point.
