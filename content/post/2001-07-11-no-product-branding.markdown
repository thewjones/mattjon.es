With their no-product branding experiment, [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/) seems to have created something which perfectly embodies the common language - verbal as well as visual - of the dotcom era. The [withjoy.co.uk](http://www.withjoy.co.uk/) site is [or **was**] every single failed online venture rolled into one. The colour scheme, the font, the rhetorical slogan, the idea that this company knows more about the way you want to live your life than you do; it is food for todays young-upwardly-mobile city dweller who doesn't know better. Thank you [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/), now let that serve as some kind of full-stop to it all.
