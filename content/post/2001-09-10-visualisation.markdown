Some clever coding at [milov.nl](http://www.milov.nl/):'Using a combination of PHP and Javascript-DOM-scripting, the structure on this page will grow in different directions depending on the number of referrers that link to it.'[http://www.milov.nl/linkthispage.php](http://www.milov.nl/linkthispage.php)This has led me to think how interesting it would be to link the software used for [Blogdex](http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/) to the [visualisation technology](http://www.thinkmap.com/) used for the [Visual Thesaurus](http://www.visualthesaurus.com/). Not quite sure what it would achieve, but interesting none the lessâ€¦Other news: It's good to see another like-minded designer/blogger based in Newcastle Upon Tyne: [pixelised.com ](http://www.pixelised.com)
