Mark Pilgrim [rocks the boat](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/13.html#semantic_obsolescence) again with an attack on the [W3C](http://www.w3.org) for deprecating XHTML tags that make his site work. The development of XHTML has seen the W3C slowly chip away at the specification of HTML, and for good reason: to make the Web leaner, faster and easier to build. Because the W3C are dropping a handful of tags like `` and ``, Mark seems to believe that they are dropping semantic mark-up.


	

The [Dive Into](http://diveintoaccessibility.org/) series of sites constitute some of the most informationally rich and well put together web sites I have ever seen. Marks vast knowledge of web development has won him respect from many web designers who read and respond to his posts on a daily basis. However, in this case, I find myself disagreeing with his self-important stance on XHTML 2 and the future of the web. Surely developing for the web is about excepting that it is in a constant state of transition towards something better and part of the challenge is not to be too reliant on certain technologies.


	

On browsing through the latest [working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20021211/Overview.html#toc) of the XHTML 2 specification, there seems to be some startling omissions like the `` tag as well as the suggestion that the `

# ` through to `

###### ` tags will be deprecated. If this is the case, then the vast majority of web sites are going to look pretty weird when XHTML 2 is implemented. But it doesn't work like that, does it? Browsers will begin to support XHTML 2 but at the same time continue to support XHTML 1 and HTML 4. Surely there will be a XHTML 2 transitional doctype allowing it to be valid with the odd `` or `` tag included. Just because XHTML 2 presents a big change doesn't mean that web sites are going to stop working tomorrow; it's aim is to make the Web more meaningful and more importantly, to make it easier for everyone to create.
