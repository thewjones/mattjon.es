[BBC News | SCI/TECH | Did life begin in deep space?](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1142000/1142840.stm)  

   

  

So [Napster](http://www.napster.com) are going to [charge money](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1142000/1142663.stm) for their service. Surely the only thing that will happen is a 'mass exodus' to free peer to peer file sharing systems like [Gnutella](http://gnutella.wego.com/) or other products that will no doubt appear.  

   

Change is coming soon.
