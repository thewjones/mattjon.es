Yes, the author of [Neuromancer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0006480411) now has a [weblog](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp).


<blockquote>’In spite of (or perhaps because of) my reputation as a reclusive quasi-Pynchonian luddite shunning the net (or word-processors, depending on what you Google) I hope to be here on a more or less daily basis.’</blockquote>


If only [Thomas Pynchon](http://www.pynchon.pomona.edu/) would do the same. [via [Kottke](http://www.kottke.org)].
