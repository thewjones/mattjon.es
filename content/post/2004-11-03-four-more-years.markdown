On [BBC Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4) this morning, [Simon Schama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Schama) called the voter turn-out in the [U.S. Presidential Election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2004) a 'rebirth of American democracy' . It's a kick in the face for the Democrats, then, that such a rebirth has seemingly resulted in a decisive win for Bush. It's a sad day for America and the world.
