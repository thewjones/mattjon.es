[Tynemouth](http://www.fgillings.freeserve.co.uk/homepage.htm) is a town on the northeast coast of England, a few miles east of Newcastle which is perfectly suited for mellowing out on a Sunday afternoon. It has a huge Sunday market called erâ€¦ Tynemouth Market, where you can procure a whole host of useless second-hand bric-a-brac to adorn your house. I bought a proper 1930s Underwood typewriter from there for just a few quid and I can't stop typing on it. There is also a stall selling super-8mm equipment (cameras, projectors etc), and one of these days I'm gonna buy a camera and shoot some stuff with it. There is also a bucketload of vinyl, although admittedly, it does consist mainly of [Perry Como](http://www.loyno.edu/~coturner/) and [Max Bygraves](http://members.tripod.co.uk/bygraves/biog.html) records.

The [Squarepusher](http://www.squarepusher.com) gig last night was excellent, he was playing bass in an improvised jazz trio consisting of a blind guy called Mick Beck playing sax and oboe and an awesome drummer called John Hession. Tom 'Squarepusher' Jenkinson spent most of the time with his back to the audience going absolutely bonkers on the bass and making all manner of noises with it. Jazz is such a pure form of music, specially when it is totally improvised like this. Awesome stuff.
