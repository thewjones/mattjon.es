I think I might sign up for the BBC's [Big Arts Week](http://www.bigartsweek.com/signup.htm) in June. It's an initiative set up by [Timebank](http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/timebank/) and the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/) to get artists and designers into schools to run creative workshops.Reid's been to [Iceland](http://www.explodingfist.com/).
