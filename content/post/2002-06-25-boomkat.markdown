At the weekend I rediscovered my record player after it had been lying under a pile of books and papers for a few months. Now I'm buying vinyl again like there's no tomorrow, mainly from [Boomkat](http://www.boomkat.com) - an excellent online record shop selling mainly electronic, nu-jazz and leftfield music.
