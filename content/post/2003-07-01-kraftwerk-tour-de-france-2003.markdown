When people ask what the first record I ever bought was, I can proudly say that it was Tour de France by [Kraftwerk](http://www.kraftwerk.com), which was an EP released in July 1983 to coincide with France's famous cycle race. I seem to remember that it was a co-purchase between my brothers and I; we liked the music on [Channel 4's](http://www.channel4.com) TV coverage of [The Tour](http://www.letour.fr/) so much that we found out what it was, pooled our pocket money, went to <del>Woolworths</del> [Boots](http://www.boots.com) and bought it. After listening to it, I wished we hadn't then proceeded to use it as a frisbee because it might be worth something by now.



	

Anyway, 20 years later, Kraftwerk are re-recording Tour de France for a [new album](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/news/03-06/20.shtml) (their first in 17 years!), the release of which is to coincide with this years Tour. After not being particularly impressed with [Expo 2000](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005A0LR/starshopcom-music-20/104-9332575-1463154), I hope Kraftwerk are getting back to the level of innovation they demonstrated with their music 20+ years ago.



	

Incidentally, the second record I ever bought was [Star Trekkin' by The Firm](http://home.wanadoo.nl/~sytze/sttrekkin/), but I think we'll just brush that one aside for now.
