Under a clear night sky, it's good to look up and sense the beauty and magnitude of space.

Unfortunately a combination of urban sprawl and inefficient street lighting means that if you live in or near a city, it is becoming the case that if you want to see stars, the only way of doing it is to get a friend to give you a sharp tap on the head with solid object.

A less painful method - if you're in the US anyway - is to partake in [National Dark-Sky Week](http://www.ndsw.org/), "an event, usually occurring in April, during which people in the United States are encouraged to turn out their unnecessary outdoor lights in order to temporarily reduce light pollution".
