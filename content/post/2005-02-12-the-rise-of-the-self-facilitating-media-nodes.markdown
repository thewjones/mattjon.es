Reaction to the first episode of Channel 4's [Nathan Barley](http://www.warprecords.com/news/?offset=0&ti_id=887) is a bit mixed judging by a few reviews and forum comments I've read this morning.



	

I thought it was a very well crafted, well observed piece of comedy  and I look forward to the rest of the series. It may seem like a diversion from Chris Morris' normally dark and twisted humour, and  I think this is a problem for most Morris fans, but I'm sure that this will change as the series progresses.
