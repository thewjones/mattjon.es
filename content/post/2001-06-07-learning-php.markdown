It's pretty strange being able to do all this stuff on a Mac and it's only until you start that you realise how powerful OSX really is. In other news: An interesting thread about [sentient software](http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2001/5/15/7241/35795) at [kuro5hin](http://www.kuro5hin.org) + [Fluorescent networks](http://www.techreview.com/web/leo/leo060601.asp) [via Stu - get a website man!] ::.
