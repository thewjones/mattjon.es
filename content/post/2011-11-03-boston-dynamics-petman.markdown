Human Beings' greatest technological leaps seem to always stem from military applications, and Boston Dynamics humanoid robot 'Petman' is no different in that respect. I look forward to the day then technology like this is developed to make our lives better, not to make war. It makes Honda's Asimo - a corporate marketing tool - look like Robbie the Robot.
