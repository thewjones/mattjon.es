This year marks the twentieth year I've been blogging, although the frequency of my blog posts for the last ten years would suggest that I'm not really much a blogger of late. I think I wrote more posts during the month of October 2000 than I have during the last ten years.

Anyway, it's a new decade (depending on your pedantry over whether a zeroth year is the first of a new decade), and I'm entering into it with optimism and lots of things to write about.
