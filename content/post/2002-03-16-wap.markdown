It's a great shame that a large percentage of people in the UK are carrying around an internet enabled device but don't feel compelled to use it because WAP is unusable. I used my phone to post this entry; the potential is unrealised. Addendum: OK, it took me a while to post that, not because it took ages to type, but because of constant disconnections; I'm lucky if I can get it working 50% of the time. This site isn't WAP enabled but you can access it through a google search.
