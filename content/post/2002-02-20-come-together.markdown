Two recently addressed but seemingly unrelated topics have just come together in a strange way. You may have noted the recent addition of the OS X downloads section on the right hand side of this page; a result of my admitted addiction to checking [Versiontracker](http://www.versiontracker.com) for the latest Mac software and upgrades. Imagine my surprise when I discover that my addiction to Versiontracker is not uncommon; according to [this Wired article](http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,50329,00.html), everyone is doing it, even the subject of my earlier post [and this is the strange bit], [Herbie Hancock](http://www.herbie-hancock.com/): '_Versiontracker is the very first site I always visit when I go to the web_'. So, my disappointment at being bracketed as some kind of 'mac fiend' freak [me?] turns to a feeling of pride as Versiontracker gets the Hancock seal of approval. Versiontracker, it's _hip_.
