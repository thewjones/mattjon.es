The [PowerMate](http://www.griffintechnology.com/audio/pwrmate_features.html) is a computer peripheral designed by Takahiko Suzuki, a jewelry designer from Japan. Its main function is simply to adjust the computer's volume control, but it can be configured for other purposes such as acting as a jog wheel for video editing.
