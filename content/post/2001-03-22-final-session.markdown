Tonight was my final web design teaching session with a group of photography students. I've had a very short amount of time to teach them the fundamentals but I think it has been a success. So… armed with only Simpletext, a browser and [Fetch](http://fetchsoftworks.com/) 3.03, here are [partially finished] portfolio sites by [Laura](http://laurarobinson.freeservers.com),  [Christina K](http://christinakolaiti.freeservers.com),  [Christina](http://angel4.freeservers.com),  [Robert](http://uncle-bob.freeservers.com) and  [Sophie](http://tallulahcracknell.freeservers.com). OK… so they all look very samey and incomplete but the important thing is that I've layed the foundations for them to go on to produce a decent site for themselves [ignore the crappy banner-ads, [freeservers.com](http://www.freeservers.com) is only a temporary arrangement]. As you might have guessed, I'm feeling quite pleased with myself… these guys didn't know much about computers nevermind the Internet before the classes began, and now I'm confident that they know their stuff.
