Named after the novel by [Philip K. Dick](http://www.philipkdick.com/), [Electric Sheep](http://electricsheep.org/) is a screen saver that uses distributed computing (like [SETI@Home](http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/)) to produce beautiful animations known as [Sheep](http://electricsheep.org/v2.5/cgi/status.cgi). A new sheep is 'born' every fifteen minutes and distributed to all the clients running the software. (via [Megnut](http://www.megnut.com))
