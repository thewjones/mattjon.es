[Commodore](http://www.commodore.net), makers of home computing classics such as the Pet, the Vic 20 and the Amiga, have produced a range of MP3 players. With names like the [mPet](http://www.commodore.net/site/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=5&tabid=45&itemid=2&sitemid=9&prod=9&cat=1) and the [eVic](http://www.commodore.net/site/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=5&tabid=45&itemid=2&sitemid=9&prod=13&cat=1&specs=1&#stopspecs), they're clearly aimed at retro-loving 20/30 something geeks like me. Most of the models have mere megabytes of storage space, but the eVic has an iPod rivalling 20 Gigabytes of space. 



	

The link is from Slashdot, so the [Commodore](http://www.commodore.net) site may be slow for a while
