Judging by the mid-seventies distaster that was [The Song Remains the Same](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002I3D/qid=1055614772/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_2/002-0722893-4876053?v=glance&s=music&n=507846) (when Punk made Led Zep not cool anymore), I must admit to being skeptical when I read that another album of live Led Zep material from the 70s had been released. Now though, having read [Meg's review](http://www.megnut.com/music/007071.asp) and seen all those 5 star reviews at Amazon, I really **need** to buy [How The West Was Won](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008OWZC/ref=sr_aps_music_1_1/026-0327893-1336441).
