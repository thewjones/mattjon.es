A reflection of the cultural diversity of the victims of 9/11 and a reminder that America is a secular country. Meanwhile, most of the remembrance services in the UK were entirely Christian affairs. It's [predicted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England#Membership) that by 2050, regular church attendance will be made by less than 100,000 people in the UK. Yet the stranglehold Christianity has on events concerning national mourning and remembrance remains strong. I often wonder why that is.
