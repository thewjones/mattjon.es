title: Cheap Digital

If there is one thing I really need, it is a cheap digital camera that I can quickly create images with. It's pathetic that I have a degree in contemporary photography and I don't generate more imagery for this site. I have an array of analog cameras at my disposal: a [lomo](http://www.lomo.com/), a [Mamiya C3](http://www.woods.iki.fi/photo/normal/mamiya-c3-1050-25_normal.jpg), a [Contax 167](http://members.xoom.it/norvegianet/contax167.jpg), a [Kodak Folding Brownie](http://www.mirrorproject.com/search/results/?term=matt+jones), a kodak range finder with a [broken lens](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/colab/1.html), but I hardly use any of them. If I do manage to find time to use them, I'll happily shoot a roll of film only for it to gather dust on the shelf in the hope that someday it gets developed. I believe that the act of taking a picture is much more pleasurable than viewing the resulting prints, the latter being dependent on how good a photographer you are. Your average holiday-maker happily snapping their loved one in front of the Eiffel Tower will invariably be satified with only 40% percent of the prints returned from [Boots](http://www.bootsphoto.com/) [a level of happiness far below that during the time of film exposure], so a large amount of money is being wasted. I waste money by not even getting as far as Bootsâ€¦ I have countless unprocessed films knocking about in my room [although not as many as [Garry Winogrand](http://www.photo.net/photo/winogrand)] because I'm just too lazy to get them processed - pathetic really. So, what I really need is a cheap digital camera which I can take anywhere and shoot stuff, then I can inject some fresh imagery to this site. If you can recommend any, [let me know](mailto:matt@frownland.com).
