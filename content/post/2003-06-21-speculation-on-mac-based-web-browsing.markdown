title: Speculation on Mac-based Web Browsing

[Spymac](http://www.spymac.com) have posted some <del>[screenshots](http://www.spymac.com/gallery/showgallery.php?thumb=1&stype=2&si=frankie&cat=500&sort=1&ppuser=1946)</del> of Panther, the new version of [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) to be released later in the year. Judging by <del>[this screenshot](http://www.spymac.com/gallery/showphoto.php?photo=35890&papass=&sort=1&thecat=500)</del>, Finder will have a Safari-like navigation system as well as have Apple's controversial Metal theme. While this change may be superficial, it could indicate the beginnings of a combined file _and_ web browser; after all, the web is simply, as [Ted Nelson](http://ted.hyperland.com/buyin.txt) puts it, "decorated directories". If this does happen - and this is just wild speculation here - then it would see Apple go a similar route as Microsoft by tightly integrating the web browser into the operating system. While this maybe bad news for third-party browser developers, at least we can expect the future of Apple browsing to support web standards thanks to Apple's open-source [Webcore](http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/webcore/). Unfortunately, the Web is at the mercy of Microsoft, and no-one really knows where they are going to take the browser with their next major version of Windows in 2005.



	

**Update:** Looks like the Panther images at Spymac have been taken offline. Ah well, Panther will be unveiled on Monday.



	

**Another Update:** The screenshots are mirrored [here](http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~12fg/Panther/) though.
