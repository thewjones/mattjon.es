It looks like Apple are up to their usual hype-mongering tricks again: [What's Behind the Apple Curtain](http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,51187,00.html) ? Update: My mistake, it seems that MacWorld Japan has already taken place [I forgot about that small technicality of World Time Zones]. Apple have increased the price of the [iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/) by $100 [I thought computers usually come down in price],  introduced a 10Gig [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) and have added [Bluetooth](http://www.bluetooth.com/) support to their products via a USB Bluetooth adapter. There's also the [23-inch Cinema HD Display](http://www.apple.com/displays/acd23/)... yeowch.
