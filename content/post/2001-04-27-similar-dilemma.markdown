J. David Eisenberg's dilemma in [this weeks issue](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/forgiving/) of A List Apart is very similar to [my experience](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/index.shtml?archive/2001_02_01_archive.html#2496123 ) while teaching the basics of HTML to a group of students. In this transitional period we are going through in the history of Mark-Up, do you teach the 'old way' [using depreciated tags like  etc], or the new way [XHTML, CSS] etc. It's a tricky decision.
