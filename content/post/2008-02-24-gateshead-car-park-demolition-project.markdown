<blockquote>

> 
> In Spring 2008, the [Gateshead Trinity Centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Centre_Multi-Storey_Car_Park), incorporating the controversial 'Get Carter' car park, will be demolished.
> 
> 

> 
> For 40 years it has dominated the town centre of Gateshead; the vision of its architect [Owen Luder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Luder) having never been fully realised.
>

> 
> The aim of this site is to host and facilitate the production of creative work based around the cultural impact of this building and its demolition.
