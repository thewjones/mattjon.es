title: Downloading RealOne Player Without Loss of Hair

wordpress_id: 758

If you're a Mac user, you're outside of the US, and you've recently tried to download the free RealOne player, then you'll know how difficult this task is without knowing the exact URL of the download. Teasing out the free player from the mass of junk contained on the [Real](http://www.real.com) site has always been difficult, but now it has been made impossible by the fact that when entering the site, you are redirected to a country-specific page which contains no information whatsoever on how to go about downloading the OS X version. Thankfully, someone has posted some [instructions at macosxhints.com](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030312154037158) on how to tell the site that you're based in the US (where all the Mac users are, apparently).
