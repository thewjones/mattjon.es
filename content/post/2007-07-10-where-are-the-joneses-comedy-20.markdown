![](/images/joneses.jpg)[Where are the Joneses?](http://wherearethejoneses.wikidot.com/) is a new sitcom produced by [Steve Coogan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Coogan), [Henry Normal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Normal), and anyone else who wants to contribute. That's because it is written collaboratively using a [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki), and the a new episode is performed and released online every day. All the content is published under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) licence.





I'm sure that just as [Wikipedia](http:www.wikipedia.org) has its detractors - mainly academics who dislike its lack of authority - this will draw criticism from established comedy writers who will say it can't be compared to the genius of comedy writers such as [Dick Clement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Clement) and [ Ian La Frenais](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_La_Frenais), [Galton and Simpson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_and_Simpson), or [John Sullivan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sullivan_%28writer%29).
