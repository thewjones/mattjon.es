title: Pancakes Wind Me Up

I got on a roll last year; I was a pancake making machine. This year they turned out like small dollops of blubbery matter, not fit to be eaten by any living thing. Maybe I should have adhered to the tried and tested [method](http://www.deliaonline.com/cookeryschool/howto/how_0000000025.asp) instead of mixing unknown quantities of flour and milk together with an egg or two. I _am_ good at omelettes though.
