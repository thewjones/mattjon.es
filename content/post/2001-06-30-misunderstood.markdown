Okâ€¦ it seems that I've been slightly misunderstood regarding my last rant about students not being interested in digital media. What I meant was that students didn't seem to be interested in **my** ideals about the web. I guess they wanted to hear less about hypertext and more about spammed-up interactivity in the form of games and flying graphics. I tried to give my talk a bit of balance, but on hindsight, I've realised that 99% percent of interactive media that these kids experience is in the form of Playstation games. So maybe I should have given my talk more of a gaming slant. Tricky.
