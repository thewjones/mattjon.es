title: Greasemonkey script to remove promoted tweets from Twitter

wordpress_id: 5205
---

Now that Twitter has gone public we can expect many changes that will keep shareholders happy but annoy long-term users of the site. For me, the addition of embedded images in the timeline breaks something fundamental about Twitter, the idea of creativity through limitation; a tweet is now 140 characters and an image (or an advert). This Greasemonkey script gets rid of the adverts, at least.
