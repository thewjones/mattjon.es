There's a [BBC News Online piece](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4382626.stm) about [Flock](http://www.flock.com).

What? [Blogging tools](http://www.blogger.com) that use web standards have existed for years.

Most web browsers are designed to let you do this. Whilst Flock is a another good browser, it seems to me that it's hardly as revolutionary as this article suggests.
