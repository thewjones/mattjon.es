Those who are negative about manned missions to Space should listen to Steve Robinson's [recorded message from Discovery](http://www.nasa.gov/returntoflight/crew/robinson_podcast.html).  Who cares about the quality of the science? We've got to get out there.  



	

On a related note, there's a big hoo-haa that this is the first Podcast from space. Doesn't podcasting involve subscription using RSS? Why can't this just simply be a recorded message? 'Podcasting'... can't stand the term.
