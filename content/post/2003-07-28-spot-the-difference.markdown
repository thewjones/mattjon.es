As a followup to my [last post](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/article/254) about [BuyMusic.com](http://www.buymusic.com), here are the adverts which have been blatantly ripped off from Apple's iTunes Music Store campaign. Not surprisingly, they're in Windows Media Format (can be viewed in [MPlayer](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/14851)):



      


  
  * [Superfreak (WMV 1.6 MB)](http://ak.buy.com/buy_assets/v6/buymusic/commercials/superfreak300k.wmv)

                
  * [Rapper's Delight (WMV 1.6 MB)](http://ak.buy.com/buy_assets/v6/buymusic/commercials/rappersdelight300k.wmv)

        

       and here are Apple's ads, which needless to say, are much more memorable:

      
  
  * [Nava](http://www.apple.com/music/ads/nava.html)

          
  * [Floyd](http://www.apple.com/music/ads/floyd.html)

                
  * [Tyra](http://www.apple.com/music/ads/tyra.html)
