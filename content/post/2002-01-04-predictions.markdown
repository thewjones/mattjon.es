Well, I've been wondering [see last post] and here's what I think the iMac 2 will be… this will be the end of the speculation, I promise:[Apple](http://www.apple.com/) need a breakthrough Macintosh, and I think the iMac 2 will go some way to reaching the level impact the original [iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/) had when it was released. One thing that is definite about the [keynote speech](http://www.macworldexpo.com/user-content/announce/announce.html) next week is that Steve Jobs will say that the iMac 2 will truly be the 'centre of your [digital lifestyle](http://www.apple.com/macosx/whatyoucando/)'. However, there has been a problem with this campaign over the past few months: lifestyle doesn't just mean sitting infront of a desktop machine, or hunched over an [iBook](http://www.apple.com/ibook/) on the train to work. We all aspire to a lifestyle of activity and health and Apple want to bring their digital products into this. The [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) was one step towards this; a small, pocket-sized mp3 player that you can take with you and use anywhere. This is why I think the iMac 2 will be a computer based on a series of portable modules:
  


  




  


  


  * There will be a compact desktop machine, one which will run the latest applications at lightning speed and this will form the hub of the modularised iMac.

  


  


  * Connected to this machine will be a flat screen LCD display which could double as a portable tablet to be used with a pen, although I think this is unlikely.

  


  


  * More likely is the introduction of another module which interfaces with the main desktop machine. This will be the PDA bit, a smaller tablet and pen device that you can take away on your travels. This could be a wireless networked device with a unique protocol for connecting with the main module of the machine at home.

  


  


  * Home movie making has always been a selling point of the Macintosh range ever since the original iMac was introduced. But there was always a problem: lack of screen space. Those 15 inch monitors don't have enough screen resolution to fit a video viewer, browser, timeline and capture bin on screen all at once. This is why I think the PDA will double as an extra monitor to provide more space for windows etc.

  


  


  * The iPod will take its place as another module of the iMac 2.

  


  


  * This new machine will share the same colours, materials and overall aesthetic of the iPod.

  


  


  * Apple will start to produce more digital devices to interface with the main module.

  

So… there are my predictions. Even if I'm a mile out, I've had fun thinking about it.
