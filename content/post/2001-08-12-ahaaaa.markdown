I expected more from the partnership of Steve Coogan and Henry Normal in '[The Parole Officer](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0283534 )'. The words 'formulaic' and 'tedious' spring to mind as the unlikely hero and his team battle the bad guys in the face of great adversity until the good guys win and the hero gets his gal. Everything is wrong about this film, Coogan doesn't cut it on the big screen, characters aren't developed properly, the plot is inconsistent and the jokes fall flat. A disappointment indeed. [Peter Bradshaw](http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,534451,00.html ) sums it up perfectly.
