title: Bread... Milk... The Lord Of The Rings DVD

I was browsing in [**H**is **M**aster's **V**oice](http://www.hmv.com/) the other day; there were umpteen copies of [The Lord of the Rings DVD](http://www.play.com/play247.asp?page=title&r=R2&title=101915) just near the entrance - an expected location for a newly released DVD of a popular film I thought. However, during the course of last week, the DVD appeared in places I didn't expect to see it. I went to [Waterstones](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/655876/202-1358633-5915844) - a **book** shop - and there they were, flying off the shelves and into hands of eager fans [this must be the place where people who've actually read the book get their copies]. I went to the petrol station to refuel my car, and there was Frodo, Gandalf et al staring at me from the pay counter next the reduced-price [Cadbury's Cream Eggs](http://www.cadbury.co.uk/) and the [Duracells](http://www.duracell.com). I wondered where else I might see them: in newsagents, post offices, shoe shops, [pasty shops](http://www.greggs.co.uk/)... on specialised Lord of The Rings vending machines. The bad news is that the 30 disc edition comes out soon; you won't be able to see for the darn things.
