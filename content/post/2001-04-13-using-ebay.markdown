title: Using eBay

I've known about [Ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk) for quite a while, but I'd never thought about actually buying something from it… until the other day. My first online auction purchase was an original Triumph Dolomite [Hayne's](http://www.haynes.co.uk) Manual… exciting huh? Actually no… it's probably very dull, but that's the beauty of Ebay; you can easily find specific things which are of absolutely no use to 99% of the population. It's like an online version of Tynemouth Market (a weekly sale of junk, antiques, bric-a-brac in a small coastal town in the Northeast of England) which is why I like it so much.
