Just listening to a promo copy of the [Cinematic Orchestra](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=1CINEMATIC|ORCHESTRA)'s forthcoming album 'Everyday' that I picked up this afternoon. It's good to see that J Swinscoe and co. haven't run out of ideas since the 'Motion' and 'Remixes' albums. The first track features [Fontella Bass](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=B5u6fmpn39f3o) who sang with [The Art Ensemble of Chicago](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Bwy59keft7q7x) on the '[Les Stances a Sophie](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=A1b821va8zzva)' album. Here's a [Quicktime](http://www.video-c.co.uk/cinematicorchestra/allthatyougive.html) [800k].
