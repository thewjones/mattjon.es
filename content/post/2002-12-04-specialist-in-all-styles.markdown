Thanks to [Mal](http://www.malross.co.uk) and [Stu](http://www.t-melt.com) for their stylesheet submissions last weekend;  this brings the total up to a more repectable 4. Each stylesheet is available for selection on the [Plink](http://www.subsist.org/plink/) site using Chris Clarke's [PHP Style Switcher](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/phpswitch/) and a public vote will commence this week to see who will win an album of their choice from the recommendations so far.  I'd like to think that in doing this competition, we've created something pretty unique and it proves the worth of designing sites using valid XHTML and CSS. Keeping the mark-up simple and meaningful has allowed others to work with it and submit their own interpretations of the how the site should be presented. So, to [Kev](http://www.sorehead.org), Tommy, [Mal](http://www.minimal.co.uk) and [Stu](http://www.t-melt.com), thanks for taking part; I think it has been worthwhile.
