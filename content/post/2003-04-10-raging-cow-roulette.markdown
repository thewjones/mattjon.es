Apparently, half the population are resistant to [vCJD](http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/CJDtype/cjdtype.htm#variant), the human form of Mad Cow Disease. That's good news, but scientists may have discovered the rather grisly explanation for this statistic: half of us are descended from [human-flesh-eating troglodytes ](http://www.channel4.com/news/2003/04/week_2/10_brain.html) that evolved the resistant gene through exposure to an earlier form of the disease.
