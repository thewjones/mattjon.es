[Bizarre Records](http://www.bizarrerecords.com) is a collection of some the oddest albums ever released. Don't be put off by the dodgy site design, there's some marvelous stuff on here (in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way). 



	

A few of my favourites: 



	


	
  * [Moscow Nights](http://www.bizarrerecords.com/pages/diverseRussiannight.html)

		
  * [Don & Seymour](http://www.bizarrerecords.com/pages/DummyDon.html)

		
  * [The Stellar Unit](http://www.bizarrerecords.com/pages/DorkStellar.html)

	

	

I just like the album covers. I haven't clicked on any of the audio links yetâ€¦ I daren't.
