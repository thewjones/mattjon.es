Damo Suzuki's flared trousers may have dated since the early 70s, but his music certainly hasn't. [Can](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)) are one of my all time favourite bands, and this is the video of 'Bring me Coffee or Tea' from their 1971 album [Tago Mago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tago_Mago).
