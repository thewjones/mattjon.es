[Here's a film](http://youtube.com/watch?v=bu2MrSxuPz8), shot by none other than [Thomas Edison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison), of a chap pulling off some tricks on a bicycle in 1899.


	

You might think that this is a clever fake, but the existence of [this page](http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/varstg:@field(NUMBER(0836))) on the American Library of Congress site suggests that it's authentic. 


	

Thomas Edison - popularised the electric lightbulb **and** the BMX Fakie trick.
