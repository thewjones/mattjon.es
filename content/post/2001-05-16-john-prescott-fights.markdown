I couldn't quite believe what I saw when I switched over to [Newsnight](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/events/newsnight/newsid_248000/248099.stm) on [BBC2](http://www.meldrum.co.uk/mhp/identzone/bbc2/index.html) and saw Mr Prescott involved in a [nasty brawl](http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1334000/1334795.stm). It was like schoolyard fight, hardly the kind of situation I would have thought a politician would get themselves into. That said, this **is** John Prescott we're talking about here and apparently it is well known that he has a very short fuse. I know he shouldn't really have thrown the first punch, but I ask you this: if someone threw an egg at your face at point blank range, would you walk by unruffled, like it never happened… or would you retaliate in some way? I think Mr Prescott temporarily forgot he was a politician and therefore a figure very much in the public eye… silly bloke.
