[Chicago Underground Duo](http://www.schl8hof.wels.at/images/duo2.jpg) played in Newcastle again on Friday night. Or more accurately, they played at the [Cumberland Arms](http://www.tyne-online.com/nightsout/pubshow.asp?record=159) in Byker. You invariably have a slightly odd evening when you go to that pub. After the gig, the duo came over to our table to finish their beer. I managed to have quite a lengthy chat to them which was great, although I think I had one too many and conversation wasn't exactly coherent. So we went downstairs to the bar at about 1.30am which was unexpectedly full of partying [sword dancers](http://www.efdss.org/library/sword.htm ). There was food; I offered chicken drumsticks and onion bhajias to Rob Mazurek but I think he prefered the bhajias. An odd evening indeed. The BBC has a review of their latest album, [Axis & Alignment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/jazz/reviews/chicagounder_axis.shtml).
