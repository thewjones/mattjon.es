There was an interesting [report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/arts/archers_20040401.shtml) on Radio 4's Today programme this morning on Brian Eno's reworking of [The Archers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/) theme.  The original music, called Barwick Green and by composer Arthur Wood has been its theme for 53 years, and has opened and ended each of its 13,546 shows. I think it's about time The Archers is brought into the 21st century and I think Eno's techno remix will help The Archers become more relevent to today's youth. The remix will be officially unveiled later today.
