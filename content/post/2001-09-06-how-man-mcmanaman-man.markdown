It was strange being at St James' Park to watch the [England versus Albania](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/football/world_cup_2002/newsid_1528000/1528072.stm) game last night. I now fully realise that football is purely a TV event. We've become so accustomed to the post match analysis, the action replays, the adverts, Alan Hansen [et al] banging on about poor defending and the media hype surrounding individual players, that the experience of the event at first hand is almost a let down. The atmosphere was amazing though, and fortunately, there was no sign of the mindless hooliganism that often casts a shadow over English football.At half time, Norman Wisdom came on for a penalty shoot out. He's a [national hero](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1251000/1251406.stm) in Albania y'know.If you're wondering about the title of this post, here's some Geordie-speak:'Howay!' = 'Come on!' or 'Come here!''How!' = A contraction of 'Howay!''How man!' = 'Come on man!' [Geordies put 'man' after almost every sentence][McManaman](http://www.soccernet.com/england/players/mcmanamansteve.html) = An England playerthus:'How man McManaman man!'The [English to Geordie Translator](http://www.geordie.org.uk/)
