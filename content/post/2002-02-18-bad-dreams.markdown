I can cope with the kind of dreams you have where you find yourself being pursued through a forest by a giant slug or you're falling through the sky only to wake up at the moment of impact. But at the weekend, I had a dream which, like the scariest horror films, was psychologically disturbing rather than scare-a-minute. I dreamt that when I looked in the mirror, I saw myself trying to copy my own moves, like that [famous scene](http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA01/Cober/marx/mirror.html) in the Marx Brothers film, [Duck Soup](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0023969) [[download 21M Quicktime](http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA01/Cober/marx/mirror.html )]. To make matters worse, my reflection would occasionally do something different just to freak me out even more. So, if there's any dream psychologists out there who would like to tell me what the hell that was all about, please do so.
