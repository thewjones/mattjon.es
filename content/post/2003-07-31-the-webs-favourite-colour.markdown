title: The Web's Favourite Colour

The quest to find [the Web's favourite colour](http://favcol.com) using images submitted via email and MMS is an interesting concept, but I'm not sure it's being successful in practice.



	

When an image is submitted, its pixel values are averaged to a single colour, so it's important that people fill the frame of their camera with their favourite colour, otherwise it is muddied by the rest of the image.  Unfortunately, people don't seem to be doing this and the result is a 'Web's Favourite Colour' that is, frankly, horrible. Maybe, if possible, the average colour should be taken from the central area of each picture submitted.



	

Of course, there's no reason why you can't simply bucket-fill your favourite colour in Photoshop and email it as a Jpeg, but I'm guessing this isn't quite as fun as sending it via MMS.
