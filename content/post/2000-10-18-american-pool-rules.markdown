title: American Pool Rules

I'm thinking of starting some sort of campaign to get [American pool rules](http://www.poolplayer.com/apa_rul.htm) played in pubs instead of flakey rules we play here in the UK. I mean, British rules allow you to play crafty snookers behind your own colour ball, making it impossible for the opponent to get a clear shot. This kind of 'ungentlemanly' play is made a bit more difficult with the American rules because (correct me if I'm wrong), the cue ball or object ball **has** to hit a cushion when a shot is played. Also, the American rules allow your opponent to reposition the cue ball anywhere on the table when you commit a foul. This is much better than having 2 shots because there are occasions when having 2 shots doesn't give you any advantage. What I want to know is who **did** come up with British pool rules and what made them decide to change them from the original rules?
