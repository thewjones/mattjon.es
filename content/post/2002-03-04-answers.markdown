Thanks to those of you who responded with answers to a few queries here of late. It turns out that 'What is real? 415 564 1347' is in reference to an event at the [SXSW festival](http://www.20x2.org/) in Austin, Texas. Twenty people have two minutes each to discuss 'What is real?'. 415 564 1347 is a US telephone number where you can discuss 'what is real?' with an answer phone. More [here](http://www.harrumph.com/020227.shtml). Also, this from [Jeff Boyd]( www.joynk.com/jeff):
  


  

    _'I happened across your [20.2.02 blog entry](http://frownland.com/index.shtml?archive/2002_02_01_archive.html#9919624) during my own exhaustive search for who recorded the incredibly funky "pinball" music from Sesame Street. Imagine my surprise to learn that someone else out there is just as interested in this as I am!'_
  


  

    Marvelous!
