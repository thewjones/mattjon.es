'Big Brother', 'Reality TV'... is this the future of the internet? In 2 years time, you will have your own 'TV channel'. You'll be mixing together your favourite films with interviews with your next door neighbours and streaming it on the internet. People will re-watch 'Wayne's World' and see it as a prophetic film.  You will be hyperlinking your video content to your friends work.  It'll be real, people's eyes will be glued to their palm machines. It'll be cheap, fast, bad quality, lo-fi, but people will still 'tune in'. The technology will sprout from the World Wide Web and find its proper place.
