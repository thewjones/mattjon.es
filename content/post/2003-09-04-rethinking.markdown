Paul Ford [gets to the heart of what a web page is](http://www.ftrain.com/ProcessingProcessing.html) and, by way of examples of "little computer languages", offers his thoughts on how the process of creating one may be "elegantized". Such is the quality of Ford's writing, I now feel compelled to start fiddling around with both [Processing](http://proce55ing.net/) and [CSound](http://www.csounds.com/whatis/index.html). I wouldn't have a clue where to start. [thanks [Stu](http://www.t-melt.com)]
