You might have seen the [Paxman interview with David Bowie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiK7s_0tGsg) from 1999, in which he talks about the "unimaginable potential" of the Internet for democratising the music industry.

I'm lucky to have experienced the Web in its infancy, and the sense that it was the start of a major and positive development in global knowledge-sharing and communication; the important factor being that it was under the ownership of everyone and not a handful of megacorporations.

I wonder what David Bowie thought of the Internet towards the end of his life, and whether it seemed like it was 'business as usual' when it comes to distribution of digital music.
