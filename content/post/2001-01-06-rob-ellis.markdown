Just had a listen Rob Ellis' album, [Music For The Home](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000050ZDE/026-7001041-9342809) [he's [PJ Harvey](http://www.wallofsound.go.com/artists/pjharvey/home.html)'s original drummer]. It's pretty minimal instrumental stuff, but it's a bit too 'cranky' if you see what I mean - much of it seems to be flurries of random notes played on piano, synth and other crazy instruments. It's obviously [Eno](http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/) inspired [hence the album name] with a bit of [Morton Feldman](http://www.cnvill.demon.co.uk/mfhome.htm) thrown in there as well.  Not sure about it, I think it's going to take a few more listens.
