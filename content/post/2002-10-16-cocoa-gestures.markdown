[Cocoa Gestures](http://www.bitart.com/CocoaGestures.html) allows you to control OS X Cocoa apps with gestures of the mouse. Here's some information on how to set it up with a tablet [the documentation currently doesn't mention this] as well as some general tips:


  


        
  1. After downloading the Cocoa Gestures disk image, copy the InputManagers folder to your Library.

        
  2. Open your tablet's preferences panel; if you're using a Wacom tablet, this will be in your Applications folder under 'Wacom'. 

    
  3. Select Tool Button options and choose one of your pen's side buttons to be a modifier [shift, option, control or command]. For this example, we'll choose 'shift'.

        
  4. Open a Cocoa Application like Chimera Navigator and from the menu, select 'Navigator > Cocoa Gestures'.

     
  5. Configure the preferences to make mouse gestures with the left mouse button [remember that by default, pressing the pen against the tablet corresponds as a left mouse button click] and select 'shift' as the modifier.

    
  6. Cocoa Gestures has a number of in-built gestures for different Cocoa apps, but you'll have to configure your own if you want really useful and intuitive gestures for each app. 


    Here are some useful gestures I have configured for Navigator:
	


   
  * rdlur [right, down, left, up, right] - reload page.

       
  * l  - go back 

     
  * r - go forward 

   
  * ru - make text bigger 

    
  * rd - make text smaller 

   
  * ld - find in page 
  

  

The gestures allow for a certain amount of fluidity, so 'right, down, left, up, right' is really just a circular motion with the pen / mouse.   

Cocoa gestures may seem a little unnecessary at first, but as you as you configure it with commands you use regularly, it becomes invaluable.
