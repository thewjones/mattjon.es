title: New Interface

An [ interesting thread](http://www.plastic.com/comments.pl?sid=01/05/18/1818239&cid=&pid=0&startat=&threshold=-1&mode=nested&commentsort=0&op=Change) about a new interface by David Gelernter "in which every information asset in your life [is] treated like an email." He discusses the way in which he uses [Eudora](http://www.eudora.com) [a mail client particularly close to the heart of mac users] to store notes and other chunks of information. I've started using Eudora to write blog entries which I then paste into the [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) form. If I haven't got time to complete the entry, I know that Eudora saves it in it's outbox so I can easily open it back it up and edit it again. It shows that interfaces intended for a certain purpose can serve as useful tools to aid other processes. Interesting stuff.
