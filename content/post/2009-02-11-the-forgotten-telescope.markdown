title: The Forgotten Telescope

When students at [South Tyneside Marine and Technical College](http://www.stc.ac.uk/home/) learned about navigation at sea, they studied astronomy using the College's planetarium and observatory. Now that navigation is done using the [Global Positioning System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS), these facilities have become sadly unused. The college, now a place for general further education, is being redeveloped, which will see the observatory demolished and the telescope relocated to Stockton-on-Tees.

Last night, a few of us were lucky to get access to the scope and spend a couple of hours observing. It's a 15" [Newtonian Reflector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_reflector) that's built like a tank, and probably also weighs as much as a tank. Situated at the top of the main college building, it is supported by a reinforced steel column than runs from the ground floor up through the stair well, so the scope is very much part of the fabric of the building. Compared to the [observatory at Kielder](http://www.kielderobservatory.org) - which is architecturally interesting but a simple timber construction - this observatory has a kind of solidity and sense of permanence about it that makes you think that, given today's need to build cheaply and quickly, its like will never be built again.
