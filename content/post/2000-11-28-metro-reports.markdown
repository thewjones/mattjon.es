A report in this mornings Metro (a free newspaper I pick up on the way to work):   

   

"Magicians have been known to make elephants, jumbo jets and even entire islands disappear. But none of the grand illusionists can claim their conjuring powers have had such a dramatic effect as those of unknown, part-time conjuror Lau Yin-Wai. He saved his neighbour from her knife wielding attacker by throwing a coat over his blade and making it disappear."  

   

How cool is that? Now there's an idea for an action film character - [Jackie Chan](http://www.jackiechan.com/) and [David Blaine](http://www.davidblaine.com/) all rolled into one.
