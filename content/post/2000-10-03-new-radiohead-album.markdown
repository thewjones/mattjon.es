title: New Radiohead Album

Listening to the new [Radiohead](http://www.radiohead.co.uk) album as I'm writing this (currently on the 3rd track). I don't  want to make much comment until i've had chance to listen to the whole album and think about it for a bit. It has received mixed reviews, probably because your average music critic likes to hear the same thing over and over again. From what I can tell so far, Radiohead are digging deeper into their influences and not really caring too much about producing pop music - which is interesting because they are a mainstream band. Maybe they don't want to be. Who knows? The 'real' inlay card is under the CDâ€¦ (is that Mr Blair?).
