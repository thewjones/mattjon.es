Matt Jones [writes](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1334000/1334092.stm) about his brief meeting with [Douglas Adams](http://www.douglasadams.com/). Not only do I share the same name as Matt [obviously], but I also share the same sentiments about Douglas Adams as well. He was an atheist, a forward thinker, an individual. If more people in the world thought like Adams did, the world would be a  better place to live in.
