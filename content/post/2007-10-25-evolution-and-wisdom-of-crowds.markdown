[Evolution and Wisdom of Crowds](http://karmatics.com/docs/evolution-and-wisdom-of-crowds.html)





An interesting article in which the author uses [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) as an example of an 'Evolution-like' system:





<blockquote>There is no question that there is something unsettling about the idea of a resource that can be edited by anonymous internet users. We would expect that many, if not most, of the edits will be of poor quality. The natural assumption might be that the quality of the end result will be the average quality of all the edits -- but nothing could be further from the truth.
