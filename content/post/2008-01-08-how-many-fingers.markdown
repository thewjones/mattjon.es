According to Rudolph W. Guiliani:


<blockquote>Freedom is about authority.</blockquote>


War is peace.

Ignorance is strength.


<blockquote>...anarchy would result if everyone were allowed to behave exactly as he wanted and cited Oliver Wendell Holmes's adage that freedom of expression does not include shouting 'Fire!' in a crowded theater.</blockquote>


That's just a lack of common sense.
