title: Anatomy of a Web Page

wordpress_id: 699

[Safari's](http://www.apple.com/safari/) Activity window displays all the component files downloaded for a particular web page. Each item is clickable, making it easy to view stylesheets, images and scripts associated to a particular site. It also makes it easy to calculate a pages size in kilobytes, useful if you're planning on entering the [5k competition](http://www.the5k.org/).



	

In Safari, go to Window > Activity
