title: Sending messages via a Google search

wordpress_id: 51

Recently, I've found myself using Google search queries as a kind of passive messaging system. For example, I make regular use of [Dave's BBC radio stream pages](http://dave.org.uk/streams/), whereby the stream URLS are scraped from the BBC site and presented in a more useable format. By way of a Google search for Dave's site, I showed my appreciation thusly:





[dave bbc streams -"thanks dave!"](http://www.google.com/search?q=dave+bbc+streams+-%22thanks+dave%21%22)





If Dave checks his server logs he'll know that his service is appreciated.
