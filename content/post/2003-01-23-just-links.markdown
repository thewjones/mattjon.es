As my occasional tinkering with the site continues, I've added a couple of new features:

I've implemented Matt Webb's [Weblog Links Sidebar](http://www.interconnected.org/notes/2003/01/Lazy_MacOSX_Weblogging_1.shtml) which is a clever [Applescript](http://www.apple.com/applescript/) that allows me to post links simply by dragging them from the browser to a folder of my choice [ie. the desktop]. With reference to Adam's [post](http://www.v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=274 ), I suppose this is my part in the de-evolution of the weblog. Maybe there's a general suffering of writer's block; a result of the declining state of world affairs playing on the mind. Who knows.

<del>My list of recommended weblog/periodicals expanded to the point of looking a little odd over there to the right, so I've decided to display a random selection of links instead. Hit reload a few times and you'll see what I mean.</del>
