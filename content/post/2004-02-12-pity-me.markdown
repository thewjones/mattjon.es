My flat is on the second floor of a terraced house which is next to a Home of some description, the second floor resident/patient of which  likes to listen to 'Heartbeat' by [Buddy Holly and The Crickets](http://www.buddyholly.com/), every dayâ€¦ 3 times. 



	

The couple living in flat directly below me like Westlife, they play Westlife almost every day. At the moment they are playing 'Uptown Girl' by [Billy Joel](http://www.billyjoel.com/). 



	

I think I need to go and have a lie down.
