Budding novelists have a cure for writer's block, it's called [National Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) (or NaNoWriMo for short). Having started on the 1st of this month, hundreds of people are writing a novel to hit the target word count of 50,000 on the 30th; that's an impressive 1666 words a day. 



	

NaNoWriMo is all about quantity and not quality; it's about getting the ideas down and not being too uptight about the quality of the prose. 



	

So, for my own benefit (although you can join in if you like), this Friday (21/11/03) is National Blog Writing Day (or uh, NaBloWriDa) in which I'm going to write 10 posts within a 24 hour period. For those prolific bloggers amongst you, that might not seem like much, but seeing how little I write these days, I think that's quite a target.
