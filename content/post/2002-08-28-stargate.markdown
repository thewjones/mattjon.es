I've been looking for a house to buy, just outside of the city. One I looked at was in a place called [Stargate](http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=416500&y=563500&z=3&sv=416500,563500&st=4&tl=Grid+Location+416500,563500&ar=N&mapp=newmap.srf&searchp=newsearch.srf); a strange name for a place I thought, especially when it's somewhere as undramatic as the outskirts of Gateshead. Apart from a non-descript clump of houses, a few roundabouts, a strange circular portal into infinity and a few cows, there wasn't really much there. 



	

Coincidentally, [the film](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0111282) was on [Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com) later that evening.
