In L. Frank Baum's [The Wonderful Wizard of Oz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz), the road along which Dorothy walks is never referred to as the 'yellow brick road'. Instead, it is known variously as:

  * the road to the City of Emeralds [that] is paved with yellow brick
  * the one paved with yellow bricks
  * the hard, yellow road-bed
  * the road of yellow brick
  * the path of yellow brick
  * the yellow bricks
