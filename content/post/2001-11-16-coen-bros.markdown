[Film Unlimited reports](http://film.guardian.co.uk/0,3968,423571,00.html) that Catherine Zeta-Jones will star alongside George Clooney in The Coen Brother's film [Intolerable Cruelty](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0138524) which will be the next film after [To The White Sea](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0176238). Let's hope 'Intolerable Cruelty' is some kind of working title because it sounds like one of those awful 'made for TV' films they show on [Channel 5](http://www.channel5.co.uk/). I went to see [The Man Who Wasn't There](http://www.themanwhowasntthere.com/) a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it; neo-noir dead-pan comedy at its best.
