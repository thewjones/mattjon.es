title: Mixing It in Newcastle

This week's [Mixing It](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/playlists/mixingitn.shtml) is a repeat of a programme first broadcast in September in which the presenters explore the alternative music scene in Newcastle. I've been a bit out of the loop in terms of what's going on gig-wise in the city centre over the last year or so, so I was expecting not to recognise many of the artists featured. So it's to my surprise that I've seen all but one of the artists on the program, demonstrating how small and neatly formed the alternative music scene is in Newcastle. The programme, which is available to [download](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio3_aod.shtml?mixingit) (RealPlayer) for the next 7 days, features interviews and music by:
