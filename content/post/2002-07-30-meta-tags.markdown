It's interesting that web designers put so much reliance on [Description](http://www.submitcorner.com/Guide/Meta/description.shtml) and [Keyword Meta Tags](http://www.submitcorner.com/Guide/Meta/keywords.shtml) when major search engines like [Google](http://www.google.com) don't even use them. This is probably why Google works so well; it only caches the one true indicator of what the site is about: its content. [This site](http://www.submitcorner.com/Guide/SE/google.shtml) has some interesting information on Googles submission and ranking process.
