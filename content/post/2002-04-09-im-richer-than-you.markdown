title: I'm Richer Than You

You would have to be both filthy rich and mad to want to spend your life on a floating apartment block ridiculously called [The World](http://www.residensea.com/home.htm). Being on a cruise is bad enough, but imagine being stuck on a ship with annoying wealthy people as they bicker over who is richer than who. It wouldn't surprise me if the ship had it's own small network of roads on which people cruise around in their Ferraris or Porches; the car being perhaps the most powerful symbol of status. I just feel sorry for the local residents of the various ports around the world who will be forced to be graced with the presence of such sickening opulence.
