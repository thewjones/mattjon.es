Tonight's BBC2 programme ['The World's Most Powerful'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/worlds_most_powerful/3284811.stm) examines the careers of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs to determine who is the most powerful computer mogul. Well we all know the answer to that one, but it might still be worth watching. **BBC2 2150 GMT**
