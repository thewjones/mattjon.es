[Brent Spiner](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Spiner,+Brent), the actor who plays Data in [Star Trek: TNG](http://startrek.com/library/episodes_tng.asp) is _54_ years old, which means he was old enough to play an android in the original series. I just thought I'd share that because I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought he was much younger.
