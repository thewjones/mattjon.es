I think my brain just imploded. Anyway, a young physicist in New Zealand has solved this paradox and in doing so has made some [ground-breaking discoveries in our understanding of time.](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-07/icc-gwi072703.php) [via [Rik](http://rik.typepad.com/blog/2003/08/there_is_no_now.html)]
