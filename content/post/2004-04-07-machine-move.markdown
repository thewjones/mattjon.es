I've moved this site, as well as work I've got in development, over to another server, a gloriously beige Dell with a _lightening_ fast 166Mhz processor and 32M of memory, so if things seem ridiculously slow then tell me. It seems to be holding up OK; Linux will run on anything (including [dead badgers](http://www.strangehorizons.com/index.pl?Contents=/2004/20040405/badger.shtml)) and [Apache](http://www.apache.org) likewise. However, it's the [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) and [PHP](http://www.php.net) side of things that I'm not quite so sure about.
