There's a report on Salam Pax - the Baghdad Blogger - on tonight's [Newsnight](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/default.stm). It will interesting to see what [Paxo ](http://www.pferguson.freeserve.co.uk/jeremy.html) (um, Jeremy not Salam) thinks of it all.

**Update**: The programme is now available as a [Realplayer  stream](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsa/n5ctrl/tvseq/newsnight/newsnight.ram) (the Salam Pax report is about 20 minutes in).
