The Guardian have announced [the winners](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/weblogs/story/0,14024,1108883,00.html) of this year's British Blog Awards. The majority of the winning entries I've never come across before, which is probably a good thing if it's going to promote lesser known weblogs to a wider audience. I'd agree that [The Big Smoker](http://www.thebigsmoker.co.uk/) is a well designed blog although its design and content have been heavily  influenced by [Gothamist](http://www.gothamist.com). There's nothing wrong with that, although I'd expect more originality from a site that's won an award for its design.
