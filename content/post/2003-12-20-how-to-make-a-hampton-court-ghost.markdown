Got a [Historic Royal Palace](http://www.hrp.org.uk/webcode/hampton_home.asp)? Would like to increase ticket sales over the Christmas period? Simple, here's what you need:



	


	
  * A black & white CCTV camera, activated and pointing to:

		
  * A large, mysterious wooden door (opened). 

		
  * A willing employee (in period costume)

	

	

For instant world-wide publicity, simply:



	


	
  * [Tell the employee to shut the door](http://images.thisislondon.co.uk/v2/news/hamptonghostL181203_450x350.jpg)

		
  * Send CCTV footage of this event to tabloid news paper claiming employee is actually a ghost.

	

	

And there you have it; spurred by the festive time of year when news should be fun and light-hearted, it shall be covered on all major news networks across the globe. Your ticket sales will surely sky-rocket over Christmas and into the New Year as visitors flock to see the 'ghost' for themselves.
