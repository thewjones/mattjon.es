Ashley Frieze's [incredible.org.uk](http://www.incredible.org.uk) is packed full of great content, from the [Haikulator™](http://www.incredible.org.uk/haiku/haikulator.html) to [Apostrophell](http://www.incredible.org.uk/apostrophell/index.html): the one person crusade to rid the world of misplaced apostraphe's… genius. What's more, it's based up here in Newcastle, as is Mal Ross' humorously written [minimal.blogspot.com](http://minimal.blogspot.com). That brings the Newcastle based independent site / weblog tally to 8, here's a list [in alphabetical order]:
  




  


  * [bifurcated rivets](http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Lindsay/weblog/latest.html) - The well established weblog from Lindsay Marshall

  


  * [frownland.com](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com) - er… me.

  


  * [incredible.org.uk](http://www.incredible.org.uk) - Ashley Frieze's simple but content-rich site [mentioned above]

  


  * [metroburner.co.uk](http://www.metroburner.co.uk) - Documenting graffiti in Newcastle. Has a [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) driven news section. 

  


  * [minimal.blogspot.com](http://minimal.blogspot.com) - Mal Ross' well written blog [also previously mentioned]

  


  * [pixelised.com](http://www.pixelised.com) - a joint effort from Leeds and Newcastle by Matt and Dan

  


  * [theoryshop.co.uk](http://www.theoryshop.co.uk) - A great independent venture from Jay. Has some nice photography too.

  


  * [xlab.co.uk](http://www.xlab.co.uk) - The weblog of my work colleague Phil Lindsay.

  

Maybe we can get an article written about us in the Evening Chronicle… or perhaps that's something to avoid.
