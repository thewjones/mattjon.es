title: Flash 5 Rant

I totally agree with [Token](http://www.k10k.com/) in his latest rant about the [Flash 5](http://www.macromedia.com/flash) interface. I've tried on numerous occasions to work it out, but I've failed everytime. It's overly complicated, cumbersome and doesn't seem to stick to any standards used in other heavyweight design packages. The only [Macromedia](http://www.macromedia.com) software I like to use is [Fireworks](http://www.macromedia.com/fireworks), but that is because many of it's shortcuts are based on standards layed down in [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/photoshop). I know Flash is a very different piece of software, but why can't it employ the same level of useability as other major applications?
