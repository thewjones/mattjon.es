title: Aqua Improvements

Craig Linton has written an [excellent piece on OS X](http://homepage.mac.com/craigandrewlinton/usability_files/index.htm) and suggests many improvements which could be made - especially to [the Dock](http://www.apple.com/macosx/theater/dock.html) - to further improve the useability of the Aqua GUI. I agree with many of his criticisms and I think the Dock is perhaps the most flawed feature of OS X; no matter how you have it configured, it always seems awkward.Of related interest, [Death of an Icon](http://www.liquid.org/macosxdock_frset.html ). I linked to this almost [a year ago](http://frownland.com/index.shtml?archive/2001_02_01_archive.html#2250375 ) and I thought I'd link it again now that OS X is becoming more widely used.
