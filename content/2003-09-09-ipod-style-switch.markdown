Apple's promotional graphics for the [new iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) are an interesting departure from the usual portraits on a white background. HTML geeks will notice that the graphics are presented using alternate stylesheets which can be switched using the coloured buttons at the top of the screen. [Sound familiar?](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0803a.shtml#apple)
