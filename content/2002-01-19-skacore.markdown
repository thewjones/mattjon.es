A few nights ago, I went to see a punk / ska band called [King Prawn](http://www.kingprawn.co.uk/). They have a massive following on the live circuit, but have never quite made it into the mainstream, which is probably a good thing. Anyway, their music had everyone jumping up and down like mad people, and I was certainly one of them. Furthermore, I believe Babar is the only person in the world who can make a [Hohner headless bass](http://www.hohnerusa.com/2000/guitars/basses/1-b2av.jpeg) guitar look [extremely cool](http://www.kingprawn.co.uk/photos/uwd10bg.jpg).
