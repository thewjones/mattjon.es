title: Space Rock 'On Collision Course'

Did that headline cause a slight twinge of fear when you read it? It did with me when I read [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2147879.stm) on the BBC's new [Science and Nature](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/default.stm) section. So is this a case of the BBC sensationalising the issue, or have we really got something to worry about? The fact is that scientists are uncertain at the moment, so a headline such as 'Space Rock _maybe_ 'on collision course'' would perhaps be more appropriate. If this 2 kilometer wide lump of rock is going to hit the Earth at 28 kilometers a second, we've certainly got a while to prepare ourselves for it; it's not due until the year 2019. Hopefully, by that time, we'll have the technology to do something about it; I think a 50 mile long, fusion powered baseball bat should do the trick.
