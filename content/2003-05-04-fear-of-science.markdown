title: Fear of Science

[The Prince of Wales](http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/) is very good at choosing scientific developments which are on the edge of public awareness and using the media to raise fear about them. Of course, Charles is an expert on [nanotechnology](http://www.zyvex.com/nano/) and therefore the right person to warn us all of the imminent threat of so-called [Grey Goo](http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?PHPSESSID=fb2fcf1802398a3bcef7f1d6bb31908d&search=grey+goo&go=Go) and I'd hate to think that this was all some kind of publicity stunt. If only such a figure publicised the benefits of science in order to get themselves in the papers, but I guess good news doesn't sell. Grey Goo exists purely in the realm of science fiction (I can recommend [Blood Music by Greg Bear](http://www.uta.edu/english/bek/cy-fi/blood.html)) and I'm sure that this is where it will stay.
