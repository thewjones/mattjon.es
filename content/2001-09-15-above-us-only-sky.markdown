I haven't written for a while, I'm not sure what to put down.         I've started to write quite a few things only to ditch them after deciding that writing about the recent horrific events doesn't seem right just now. Insteadâ€¦ [our lonely planet](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap11ann/kippsphotos/6550.jpg).Other news: A quick browse through the archives of this site will reveal that many of my links are [[via Stu](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/index.shtml?archive/2001_08_01_archive.html#5214480)]. This site wouldn't be the same without the regular doses of inspiration that Stu has emailed from London over the past year. A long overdue weblog is finally online which means I can now credit Stu properly by using a [hypertext link](http://www.t-melt.com/). Visit regularly.
