Apparently, [this video [Quicktime, 4 Meg]](http://www.straightnochaser.org/Ballad%20of%20Bilbo%20Baggins.mov) has been included as an extra on the [Lord of the Rings DVD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RDP8/) release. Seriously, there's something deeply disturbing about the likes of Shatner or Nimoy trying to entertain with their non-existent singing voices. I bet [Peter Falk](http://www.geocities.com/TvPilotGuy/columbo.html) never lowered himself in such a way.
