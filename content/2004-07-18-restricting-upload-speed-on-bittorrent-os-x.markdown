title: Restricting Upload Speed on BitTorrent OS X

If you press the lozenge shaped Aqua button - the one that seems to do different things for different applications - on the top right of the  [BitTorrent](http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/) client window, you can restrict the maximum upload speed to an arbitrary value. Useful if you want to stop BitTorrent from hogging your bandwidth, especially if you've got an [HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/) set up etc. Just thought I'd point that out as it's not an obvious feature and understandably so; if every BitTorrent user restricted their upload speed, the software would suddenly become less useful. Hmmâ€¦ maybe I should [keep schtum](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/215700.html).
