According to [this BBC report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3268161.stm), a study has shown that parents in America are increasingly naming their children after global brand names. First names that these kids are lumbered with for the rest of their lives include:



	


	
  * Chevrolet

		
  * Armani

		
  * L'Oreal (because she's worth it)

		
  * Timberland

		
  * Del Monte (he say yes!)

		
  * ESPN (?)

		
  * Denim

		
  * Canon (if anyone can)

		
  * Courvoisier

	

	

Thankfully, no-one seems to have named their child 'Microsoft' yet.
