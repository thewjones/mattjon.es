There's a big difference between using a flag to show pride for your country and using a flag in the name of nationalistic hatred of other countries. Unfortunately, it seems that [Warwick University](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/) sees the English flag as being a symbol of the latter; they have [banned it](http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2002%2F05%2F18%2Fnflag18.xml) from being displayed on-campus during the [World Cup](http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/). It seems that the St George's flag has become inextricably linked to football violence and this action by Warwick University will not help to lift the image the flag, already tarnished by hooligans who use it as a symbol of supremecy.
