Another new feature in [iTunes 4](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) is the ability share individual track URLs.



	

  


  * With sharing enabled in the preferences panel, _control-click_ on a track in your library to bring up its contextual menu.
  


  * Select 'Copy Sharing URL' and paste it into an HTML document or an email.
  





	

This is particularly useful if you produce your own music; you can publish track URLs and serve them up from your own iTunes library.
  *[URLs]: Uniform Resource Locator
