The guy who did [Amazon Light](http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon/) has had a '[Cease & Desist](http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon/about.asp)' order from [Google](http://www.google.com), who obviously weren't very happy that their UI was being used to sell products on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com). Everyone else thought it was brilliant though, and it demonstrated how the relatively easy-to-use interface that Amazon has can be simplified even further.
