I second [Luke's](http://www.captainfez.com/blog/) recommendations for decent minimalist classical stuff. That [Glass CD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004SSJ2/qid=976293539/sr=1-25/026-0617916-9523622) on the NAXOS label is only about 5 quid - so I agree, it's a must buy. [Maximum Minimalists](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004S1ED/026-0617916-9523622) is also a good one to get if you want a general flavour of this genre of music (or is it a 'movement'?). I also recommend [Morton Feldman](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000J8RO/026-0617916-9523622) (who's compositions sometimes last for 5 hours or so) and [Gavin Bryers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000040UT/026-0617916-9523622) ('Jesus Blood Never Failed Me Yet' involves an hour long loop of a tramp singing in the streets of London - sounds bonkers but it's actually really moving).
