I've been interested in the work of [Ted Nelson](http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/) ever since I watched [Douglas Adams](http://www.douglasadams.com/)' [seemingly forgotten about] documentary '[Hyperland](http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/hype.html)' back in 1990. Ted Nelson coined the term 'hypertext' in the 1960s when he started [Xanadu](http://www.xanadu.com/), a "project [which] foresaw world-wide hypertext decades ago, and endeavored to create a much deeper system". It seems that Nelson is bitter about the success of the world wide web and it's 'one-way' hypertext system and this is especially evident if you [read his home page](http://ted.hyperland.com/notherview/). I admire Nelson's work, and the Xanadu model seems like a much more complete solution than hypertext as we know itâ€¦ but where is Xanadu? After 40 years of development and the birth of the global network of computers, I thought we might have seen something by now, something we can download and try out for ourselves.Thanks to Stu at [t-melt.com](http://www.t-melt.com/) for emailing [this link](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1581000/1581891.stm) regarding Nelson's current views on the WWW. I also found [A Subjective Chronology of Literary Hypertext](http://raven.ubalt.edu/staff/moulthrop/chrono.html), which is also an interesting read.
