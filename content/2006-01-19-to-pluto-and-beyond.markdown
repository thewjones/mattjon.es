Nasa's [New Horizons](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/) probe has just launched on its 9 year journey to [Pluto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_%28planet%29), [Charon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_%28moon%29) and the [Kuiper Belt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_Belt). Broadcast live on [NASA TV](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/), they're currently showing virtual footage of the probe based on telemetry data it is sending to NASA control. 



	

I'll post more in nine years time when the first pictures arrive!
