In true web geek fashion, here's an unordered list of things I did over the Christmas and New Year period:



	


	
  * Drove nearly 1000 miles

		
  * Visited [Jodrell Bank Observatory](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/)

		
  * Watched a talk by Radioastronomer [Dr Tim O'Brien](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~tob/) about Mars and the ongoing search for Beagle 2 

		
  * Visited [Stonehenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge)

		
  * [Fainted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fainting)

		
  * Handled a neolithic vase (4000 - 6000 years old and in perfect condition)

		
  * Dropped neolithic vase (not really)

		
  * Went, spectacularly under-dressed, to a New Years party at a Castle in Wiltshire (it's a long story)

		
  * Built a web site

		
  * Visited [Woodhenge ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodhenge)

		
  * Gained weight

		
  * Observed [the moon](http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) through a cheap telescope

		
  * Took photographs

		
  * **Addendum**: I knew there was something I was forgetting, I became an Uncle.
