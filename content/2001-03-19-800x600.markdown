The [800×600](http://www.webreview.com/2001/03_16/webauthors/index01.shtml) debate? I personally believe that designing 'liquid' pages is important; I like being able to open my favourites sidebar [on IE5/Mac] and having a daily browse through various weblogs and news sources without having to collapse the bar. Designing flexible sites is not only good practice as it  makes browsing easier for the end user, it also creates a bit of a challenge. I have respect for those web designers who can create flexible pages without sacrificing the quality of their layout design. ::: [Email -  'third revolutionary step in human communication](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/17687.html)'? That's a big statement. ::: [Coke on tap](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1228000/1228266.stm)? That's right mums and dads… stick a coke-tap on your sink and watch your kids freak out on caffeine and sugar while their teeth slowly rot away [Donald Daft? Has April Fool's Day come early?].
