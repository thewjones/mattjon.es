title: Fox Hunting Ban

It looks as though there will be a total [ban on fox-hunting](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1123000/1123412.stm), and about time too. I did some documentary photography work at a pro-hunting rally once and I can safely say that the hunt supporters I met there were - stereotypically - a bunch of useless arrogant toffs. Hard luck ladies and gents, I'm afraid you're not going to have the enjoyment of chasing a defenceless fox around fields with a large pack of ill-treated dogs, only to watch as they eventually rip their quarry to pieces. Shame.
