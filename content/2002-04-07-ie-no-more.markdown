The latest build of the [OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx) web browser Chimera - now simply called 'Navigator' - is available to [download](http://chimera.mozdev.org/installation.html). It's still far from being a finished product but the main change from previous versions is that it now supports Quartz rendering.
