The UK's first major offshore wind farm [has started generating power](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3225784.stm) off the coast of North Wales. Although it's the first _major_ wind farm, Blyth's [two offshore turbines](http://www.offshorewindfarms.co.uk/im/rgb/2wtgs.jpg) have been spinning since 2000, at which point in time they were the largest of their kind in the world. 



	

I don't understand why some people dislike wind turbines; as well as their purpose of generating energy cleanly and efficiently, they're huge kinetic sculptures which, like other public artworks, uplift their surrounding environment. 



	

Some animal welfare experts believe that large wind farms are a [hazard for sea-birds](http://www.rspb.org.uk/policy/windfarms/index.asp). I suspect we're underestimating the intelligence of birds to fly clear of them.
