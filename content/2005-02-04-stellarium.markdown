[Stellarium](http://stellarium.free.fr/) is a really nice piece of cross-platform astronomy software released under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). It discards the complex controls usually associated with such software and is perfect for wannabe amateur-astronomer laypeople like me to locate objects in the night sky. 



	

The rear window of my flat has a southeasterly view over the North Sea, and I was able to use the software to locate both [Jupiter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(planet)) and [Saturn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(planet)) as they made an appearance through the window over the course of the evening. Through my recently acquired small refractor telescope, I was amazed to see Jupiter's major moons and Saturns rings, which is something I never thought possible using a small scope.  



	

OS X users may be disappointed by the fact that Stellarium runs full screen and doesn't use Aqua, but it's still a very nice looking piece of software as it uses [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/) to render its graphics. Also, the OS X version has a rather nasty icon, so I made one myself which is presented above (PNG version).
