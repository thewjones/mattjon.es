Another day and the same old routine. Last night, we decided to cook [salmon](http://www.riverdale.k12.or.us/salmon.htm) with lemon and coriander with all the trimmings (well.. i say 'last night', it was more like 1 O'Clock this morning!... oops). Is it bad to eat a meal before going to sleep or is that an old wives tale? Whateverâ€¦ it was good to eat proper food for a change instead of living on 'Goodfellas' pizzas from the cornershop.
