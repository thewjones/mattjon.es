title: Geotagging with Flickr

wordpress_id: 81

I've started [geotagging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geotagging) some of my photos in [Flickr](http://flickr.com), so you can see where some my images were taken using my [Map page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattj/map/). 


	

It's a pretty interesting feature, although the quality of the street-level mapping on Yahoo isn't particularly good, making it difficult to accurately pinpoint the exact location of each image.
