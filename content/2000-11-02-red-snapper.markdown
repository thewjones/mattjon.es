[Red Snapper](http://www.warprecords.com/warp/file/redsnapper/) are playing up here on Friday which should be good. I much prefer their earlier stuff (Reeled & Skinned, Prince Blimey) to Making Bones (I haven't heard their latest album so I can't really comment on that). I'm not sure about the addition of an MC since the Prince Blimey albumâ€¦ it seems they're going for mass appeal rather than unique sounding music (as contained on their earlier albums). Whatever, I'm up for a bit of live music anyway.
