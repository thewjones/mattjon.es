Are 360 degree immersive videos the future of webcasting? Decide for yourself by going to [Be Here](http://www.behere.com) and checking out the [360 Gallery](http://www.behere.com/gallery.htm). To view them, you'll need either [Realplayer](http://scopes.real.com/real/player/player.html?src=001010realhome_2,001010rpchoice_h2&amp;amp;dc=102010191018), [Quicktime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/) or [Windows Media Player](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/download/) with additional components which should download automatically. Click [here](http://lsd.bb.worldonline.de/bb/redirect.lsc?stream=cam10_real_400.rm&amp;amp;conte) for the live 360 degree stream from the Big Brother house in Germany (it pains me to promote such mindless entertainment, but it's a good illustration of how this technology could be used to broadcast live events).
