Hey, I could get used to this [blogging](http://www.blogger.com) thing, although it becomes a bit addictive after a while, which is bad.
  

  

...  

If you find this colour scheme a bit harsh on the eyes, please let me know… i've realised that it is not quite as readable as it could be (especially on brighter monitors). You kind of get used to it after a while though… honest.
  

  

...  

If you haven't seen [O Brother, Where Art Thou? yet, go and see it. It's slightly more mainstream than other [Coen Brothers](http://uk.imdb.com/Name?Coen,+Joel) films, but it's still kicks the arse of most of the pap that appears on our cinema screens.
