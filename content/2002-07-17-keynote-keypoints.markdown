Macslash has a [round up](http://www.macslash.org/articles/02/07/17/155241.shtml) of all the announcements at Apple's Keynote speech a few hours ago. The highlights for me are: [Rendezvous](http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/rendezvous.html), [Sherlock 3s Web Services](http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/sherlock.html), and [Junk Mail](http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/mail.html). However, there _is_ one lowlight: the '[Del Boy](http://www.mgnet.karoo.net/aroyalflush.jpg)' style [fur](http://www.apple.com/macosx/).
