<blockquote>I believe our only hope for the future it to adopt a new conception of
human ecology, one in which we start we reconstitute our conception of
the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our
minds in the way that we have strip-mined the earth for a particular
commodity, and for the future it won't service. We have to rethink the
fundamental principles on which we're educating our children.

In a [stunning talk](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/66) for the [TED](http://www.ted.com) conference last year, [Sir Ken Robinson](http://www.sirkenrobinson.com) argues that our education system is based on old fashioned ideas of achievement; that the goal of education is to put titles before and after our names, rather than equip children for a changing world.  He argues that creativity is educated out of us, and creative subjects such Art, Drama and Dance are very much secondary to more 'academic' subjects such as Languages and Sciences.

I experienced this process as I progressed through the education system, and I'm seeing its effects in my current place of work, where productivity is blighted by a lack of creative thinking. Furthermore, I know many people for who School education did not work, yet I consider them to be incredibly intelligent people. Robinson talks about a spectrum of intelligence in our society, however it seems that only a small part of this spectrum is addressed in our schools.
