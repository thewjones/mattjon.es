Wellâ€¦ I managed to get half of the redesign done over the weekend but as ever, my tendancy to procrastinate like hell got the better of me and I ended up doing very little. From what I've done so far though, I think it's an improvement. Should be online soon.

I bought the [Blue Jam CD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004YL1M/026-0819497-2645201) on Saturday and it's been disturbing me all weekend. It's pretty shocking stuff, almost to the point where I feel quite ill when I listen to it. [Chris Morris](http://www.koekie.org.uk/funnel/) seems to have edited together all the darkest stuff from the radio series and most of it makes for difficult listening. It was filed under 'humour' in the record shop, it should be filed under 'dark' . Good stuff though.
