title: Launching Tabs, Not Windows

wordpress_id: 743

One of the best features of [Camino's](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/) tabbed browsing system is the ability to launch links from other applications into the new tabs rather than new windows. This is useful when browsing with [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/); a series of headlines can be chosen for later reading without having multiple windows littering the screen. I was hoping that the latest beta version of [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) would include this useful feature, but unfortunately it seems to have been overlooked. **Update:** [J sets the record straight.](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/article/196#comment597)
