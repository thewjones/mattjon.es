Visiting [Jodrell Bank](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/) when I was a kid was always an amazing experience; and after watching Tom Baker as [The Doctor](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/doctors/doctor4.shtml) fall from its great height on TV when I was about 4 years old, it became a place of awe and mystery. Just what **was** that huge breakfast bowl on metal legs doing there? Seeing it dominate the horizon as I sat on the back seat of the family [Peugeot 504](http://www.calligramme.com/504/gamme_GB.htm) is an image permanently etched on my mind. It was the biggest thing in the world. And nowâ€¦ after [uncertaincies about its future](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_838000/838092.stm), it appears that Jodrell Bank is [getting upgraded](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1243000/1243232.stm) so that it can study the cosmos [and search for intelligent life] more effectively. I'm glad.
