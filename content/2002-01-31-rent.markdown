I really am sick of renting houses. I was up 'til Stupid O'clock last night trying to get my house straight for todays inspection by the landlord. What's worse is that a flatmate recently moved out so I'm having to pay extra rent which I can't really afford. Fortunately, house prices are pretty low in the Northeast of England, at least in comparison with the ridiculous amount you have to pay in the Southeast. Perhaps the fact that I'm paying too much rent is a good thing, because it will motivate me to finally start looking at houses to buy. Hey, another [weblogger](http://minimal.blogspot.com/) based in Newcastle. That brings the total up to an incredible 5 [that I know of].
