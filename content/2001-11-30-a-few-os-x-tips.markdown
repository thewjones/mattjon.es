title: A few OS X tips

* Is your dock getting a bit too full with all the cool stuff you've downloaded? Try making a new folder and filling it full of aliases to other apps and utilities. Then drag the folder to the dock to create a sub-menu of apps:

  * Earlier versions of OS X omitted one of the most useful shortcuts for designers, the quick screen grab. Thankfully, this has been returned in 10.1 :

    * **shift-command 3:** grab the entire screen


    * **shift-command 4:** grab a selected area


    * **shift-command 4 with caps-lock** grabs a window in 9.x, but this seems to have been omitted in 10.1




  * Pressing **alt-command** while clicking on a dock item will switch to that application and hide all the rest. 


  * [ASM](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/asm.html) returns the application switcher menu to the top-right of the screen


  * [Pin Cushion](http://makeashorterlink.com/?H1572123 ) allows you to place the dock in the corner of the screen.
