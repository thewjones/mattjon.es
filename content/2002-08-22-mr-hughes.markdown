Reading the collection of 'end of world scenarios' at [Exit Mundi](http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Emke/exitmundi.htm) reminds me of my old Geography teacher, Mr Hughes. He used to sit there at the front of the class, rumbling about how we're all going to die in some natural disaster. He droned on about the Earths increasing over-population and how, if an asteroid did knock out the odd continent or two, it would be '_a blessing in disguise_'. Shocking really. Even though we cowered behind our desks during his somewhat terrifying lessons, he was a very good teacher and it was with sadness that I recently discovered that he is now wheelchair-bound after suffering from a severe stroke. So here's to Mr Hughes; thanks to you I'll never forget what a [Roche Moutonee](http://www.homepage.montana.edu/~geol445/hyperglac/eroland1/rouchedef.htm) is.
