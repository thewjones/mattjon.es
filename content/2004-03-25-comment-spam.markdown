Coinciding with the hoo-haa surrounding the announcement of Six Apart's [Typekey](http://helium3.blogdns.com/archive/2002/07/37) - a centralised weblog comment system aimed at reducing comment spam for MT and Typepad users -  I had my own comment spam attack last night. It occured in [this post](http://helium3.blogdns.com/archive/2002/07/37) about meta-tags from July 2002, and, in amongst the flood of messages, the spammer suggested that I was a nerd. A deep insult I think you'll agree; geek maybe, but not a nerd. 



	

Anyway, as I doubt I'll be using Typekey in the future, I'm  sticking to a more 'nuts & bolts' method of deterring spammers. Through a bit of detective work using [Refer](http://www.textism.com/tools/refer) and my [Apache](http://apache.org) access logs, I found the spammer's IP address and country (Australia). Then with a bit of .htaccess jiggerypokery I blocked the spammer and sent them to [this 403 page](/403.html). Umâ€¦ maybe I am a nerd :-/
