[PiertoPier](http://www.piertopier.net/) are a group of WiFi enthusiasts who have set up a wireless network on Brighton beach, allowing people to use* the web and check their email while relaxing and soaking up the sun.



   It's a great idea, but I think it would only ever work on beaches like Brighton which are pebbly rather than sandy. Knowing sands magnetic attraction to the inner workings of expensive digital cameras as well as ham sandwiches, would you take your [Powerbook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook) to the beach?
