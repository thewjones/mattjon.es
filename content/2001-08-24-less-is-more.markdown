When I was a youngster, it was my ambition to be an architect. I used to sit for hours with a cheap [Staedtler](http://www.staedtler-uk.co.uk/) drafting board and create precise drawings in perfect perspective. I was obsessed by the accuracy of it; each line was carefully calculated using a protractor and a pair of compasses, it was all arcs, foci, and intersectionsâ€¦ abberations were carefully removed by one of those neat plastic erasers. However, a few years later I lost interest in it; I realised that I wasn't cut out for the maths and physics knowledge needed to be a designer of buildings. During this time however, I read up on all the famous architects, my favourite being Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. He designed some wonderfully minimal buildings, an aesthetic that I understood and one which appealed to me even at an early age.
