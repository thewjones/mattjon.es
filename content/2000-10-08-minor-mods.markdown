As you can see, I've made [a few modifications](old.shtml) to the design of this site. The main one being that you can actually read [this text](index.shtml) without getting a bad headache. I've also started to introduce some imagery to the pageâ€¦ expect loads more soon. I'm also working on [Apple](http://www.apple.com) style multiple flavours, so that you can pick your favourite colour scheme. As I've only just uploaded this new version, it hasn't yet been tested on different platforms and browsers (I have designed it using IE5 on a Macintosh). I know for a fact that it looks particularly flakey on Netscape for Mac and i'll get this sorted out as soon as I can. I'm still a long way off finishing it, but overall I think it is a vast improvement.
