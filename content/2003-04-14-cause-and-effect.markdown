So it is technically impressive and the film-makers may have sweated over 600 takes to get the shot, but, to agree with [Adam](http://www.v-2.org/displayArticle.php?article_num=424), I find the new [Honda ad](http://www.beam.tv/beamreels/beamreel.php?dzjgijxl) to be a dazzlingly [unoriginal](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0094300) piece of work. Perhaps its only redeeming feature is its lack of heavy-handed CGI; these events really happened, which I suppose counts in its favour.
