[Matt Webb](http://www.interconnected.org/home/2003_02_16_archive.shtml#90339657) speculates that the real reason for the [Blogger acquisition](http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml#000802) is to enable Google to feed the entire Blogger archive _"into [OpenCyc](http://www.opencyc.org/) to create a composite artificial intelligence"_. That or they're planning to build [The General](http://www.the-prisoner-6.freeserve.co.uk/episode_six.htm).
