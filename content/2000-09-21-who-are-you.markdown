If you're reading this, and this entry is only one of a few so far, then a) i must know you or b) you have just 'happened' across this site. In either caseâ€¦ hello. As you can probably tell, I haven't quite finished the general design of the site yet and a few important design decisions need to be made. The features section at the top will contain images, short films, animation,  writing,  and will be updated on a weekly basis. This section (what you may call a [weblog](http://www.blogger.com)) will be updated daily with thoughts, reviews, and links to cool stuff. I'm also working on a faq (Frequently Asked Questions), which will explain a little more about what the hell is going on. In the meantime,  just [send mail](mailto:m@frownland.com).  this is just the beginning.  cheers, matt.
