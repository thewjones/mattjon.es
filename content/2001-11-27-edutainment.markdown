On Thursday, I'm chairing a stand at an open day for school kids to come along and learn about employment. You might think that the age of 10 or 11 might be a little early to start thinking about getting a job, but the day isn't really about that. Employment may be an alien concept to some of these kids; they may come from single parent families where the mother or father is on income support and has been for all of the childs life. Really, the day is aimed at educating the kids about the concept of opportunity; so that they may go away with new ideas in their minds. So, I need to present something that will engage and entertain them. I've got a pretty good idea of what I'm going to show, but [any suggestions](mailto:matt@frownland.com?subject=Got a website for ya) for fun, engaging websites would be greatly appreciated.
