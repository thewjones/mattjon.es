I had planned a bit of a spring clean / re-design round here over the weekend (again), but the weather was far too good to be sitting indoors. So we had a tour up the Northumberland coastline and visited [Alnmouth](http://members.netscapeonline.co.uk/swaroberts/), [Alnwick](http://www.castles.org/castles/Europe/Western_Europe/United_Kingdom/England/england.htm) and  [Craster](http://www.cpoint.co.uk/tw/locales/l544.html) [home of the oak smoked kipper]
