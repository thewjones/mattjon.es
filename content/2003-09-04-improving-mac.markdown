While much of Apple's website is well laid out and easy to use, the news that [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com) and [Doug Bowman](http://www.stopdesign.com) are teaming up with [Apple](http://www.apple.com) to (presumably) push the site towards standards compliance and accessibility is very welcome. However, there is one member of the Apple.com family that, I believe, requires special focus; the [.Mac site](http://www.mac.com). This site is an attempt to make a web page look and feel more like the 3-paned interface seen the [iLife](http://www.apple.com/ilife/) apps; the brushed metal effect is an annoyance on the desktop nevermind on a website. Apple have made the mistake of believing that in order to make the .Mac site (and the tools within it) as user friendly as possible, it must behave in a way that Mac users are familiar with, i.e. the iApps. I have a .Mac subscription, used primarily for POP3 mail and the excellent Backup utility. However, it is rare that I use the .Mac site simply because it offers a poor user experience. I'm not compelled to go back to it to see what's new and as a fee-paying subscriber I expect more. 



	

Although it's unknown how this alliance with Apple will develop, I personally hope that Zeldman and Bowman will be working to create a faster, leaner, more usable .Mac site using XHTML, CSS and not a whiff of brushed metal.
