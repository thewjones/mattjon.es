I know little about the country of [Bulgaria](http://www.bulgaria.com/). I had to look at my world atlas before I knew its exact location. However, what I discovered last night was that their traditional music is inspiring. [Angelite](http://www.jaro.de/Artists/Bulgeng1.html ) are a 20 strong female choir who sing a mixture of religious and traditional Bulgarian songs and they performed in Newcastle last night. What these people can do with their vocal chords is incredible, then there's the [traditional clothing](http://www.arts.omega.bg/folk_costumes.htm) which seems to be all about wearing as much contrasting colour as possible. It reminded me that I have become very lazy with colourâ€¦ can you tell?
