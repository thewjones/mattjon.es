Oh dearâ€¦ what has happened to [Netscape](http://www.netscape.com)? Not only have they produced one of the worst-looking pieces of [software](http://home.netscape.com/download/1019100/10004-----_qual.html) I've ever seen (although [Cleaner 5](http://www.terran.com/cleaner/) is getting close it), it also looks as though they've [failed](http://www.oreilly.com/news/flanagan_1100.html) to implement the standards that promised to make life easier for web designers.  Why?
