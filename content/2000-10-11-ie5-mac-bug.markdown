title: IE5 Mac Bug

wordpress_id: 1579

If anyone knows anything about an apparent bug in [IE5 for Mac](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/ie/) that makes some of the links below fail to respond, please tell me about it because it's pissing me right off. I don't know whether it's a problem with my system configuration or what, although I've tested it with different browsers on a PC and it works fine. Any ideas?
