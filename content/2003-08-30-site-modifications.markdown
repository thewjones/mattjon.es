I've been busy improving the code behind this site. Modifications include:



	


	
  * Improved [archive](/archive/). Until now, most of my posts have been stored in Blogger outputted archives. I've now imported these posts into the MySQL database in order for the archive to be consistently formatted. 

		
  * Even more human-friendly URLs. You can modify the URL to go directly to a monthly archive, for example [2002/june/](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/archive/2002/june/). The old URLs still work.  

		
  * Date headers: Influenced by the likes of [t-melt](http://www.t-melt.com) and [Daring Fireball](http://www.daringfireball.com), i've added right-aligned date headers to each days posts.  

	

	

I think there are plenty of bugs to iron out, so if you spot anything, [let me know](/contact/).
