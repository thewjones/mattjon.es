The word 'blog' seems to have made it into the technology journalist's vocabulary. However, they still seem to be having real problems with the word 'weblog', and [this BBC News article by Jo Twist](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4278241.stm) has the most confused version I've seen: 'web blog'.



	

I suppose the word 'blog' as a neologism is acceptable because it can't be interpreted as a typing error, whereas 'weblog' looks as if the writer might have missed a space between two words, prompting irate emails of from non media-savvy BBC News readers.
