Musician and scientist Henry Alan Hargrove has released an [album of original compositions](http://www.dnamusiccentral.com/index.html) based on the DNA base pair sequences of the Human Genome.

> To be true to the DNA of the genetic code, the actual ATCG  base pair sequences need be maintained in DNA music.  This is by nature very restrictive.  Just as adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine are in themselves complex molecules, the musical phrases used to portray them can also be somewhat complex.  The task that faces the composer here is to create phrasing that opens, provides substance to the body, then closes the piece successfully.

It's actually much more musical that you'd think, in fact [Moondog ](http://www.moondogscorner.de/frame.html) and late [Miles Davis](http://www.milesdavis.com/) spring to mind.
