title: Continuing r|o|o|m| Project

I've been looking for ways to continue [this project](http://www.unn.ac.uk/~inmj2/room/) for over a year, and a possible collaboration with the [v-2 organisation](http://www.v-2.org) may allow me to do this. Read: [building code = genotype / architecture = phenotype](http://www.v-2.org/genotype.html). I have a strong interest in the use of metaphor to describe the many 'systems' that crop up in our lives. [Gravity's Rainbow](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099533219/026-0515500-5862055) by [Thomas Pynchon](http://www.hyperarts.com/pynchon/) is a good novel to read on this.
