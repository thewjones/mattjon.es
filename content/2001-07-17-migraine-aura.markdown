If, like me, you suffer from migraine with aura, you will recognise [this](http://www.upstate.edu/neurology/haas/hpmiaud.htm) or [this](http://www.upstate.edu/neurology/haas/hpmiaus.htm). If you don't know what I'm talking about, auras are the annoying forewarning to a migraine attack; weird disturbances in vision which occur about an hour before the onset of intense headache and sickness.
