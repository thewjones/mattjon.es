Here's another [useful PHP script](http://www.textism.com/article/638/) courtesy of [Textism](http://www.textism.com). When a person visits your site via a google search, this script reads the search string entered and highlights the words on the resulting page. By way of demonstration, do a web search for '[conjugate lateral eye movement](http://www.google.com/search?q=conjugate+lateral+eye+movement)', and you will see how it works.
