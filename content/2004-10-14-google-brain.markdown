Not content with indexing 4,285,199,774 web pages, Google now wants to [index your hard drive](http://desktop.google.com/). This is not for the benefit of others of course; it's so that you can search within your own Word documents, emails and visited web pages. Still, it's a little scary though isn't it? Think of all that information Google has access to.



	

Maybe, in a few years time, we will give the Googlebot direct access to our brains. Could be handy, I'm always forgetting where I put my car keys.
