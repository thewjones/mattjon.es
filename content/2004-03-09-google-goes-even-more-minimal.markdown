By way of Jesse Ruderman's [Toggle Google Look](http://www.squarefree.com/archives/000369.html) bookmarklet, I've been using Google's redesigned interface for a few days now. At first, the changes didn't seem enough to warrant a blog post, but the more I use it, the more I notice the many subtle re-arrangements that have been made. 



	

The before and after screen grabs below show that the changes are more about what Google have taken away rather than added. Click to enlargeâ€¦
