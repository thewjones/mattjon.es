title: When Plans Go Wrong

Don't you just hate it when you plan to get something done over the weekend, then just laze around for a few days? I hate that. I had intended to get [jackmaster.net](http://www.jackmaster.net) online because i'm way over the deadline with it (like 3 months over!). It is a website for a friends film/music production company (he's currently working on a video for [T.A.O.E](http://www.campfabulous.com)). I was also going to add some other sections to this site. Did I do either of these things? Nope. I sit in front of Macs all week and I couldn't really face spending the weekend doing it. Taking on work other than your full-time job is a bad move, unless you're a complete workaholic.
