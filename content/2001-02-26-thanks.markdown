Thanks to [James](http://lithe.uark.edu/~jemartin), [Timo](http://www.elasticspace.com) and [Rik](http://www.mememachine.net) for their comments and advice regarding [my dilemma](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/index.shtml?archive/2001_02_01_archive.html#2496123) [as mentioned a few entries ago]. That's appreciated, ta. 

  

Just bought myself [a motor](http://www.fortunecity.com/silverstone/healey/405/dolomite.html) to runaround inâ€¦ who needs these new fangled economical cars anyway?
