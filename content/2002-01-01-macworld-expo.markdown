_'6 days to Macworld San Francisco. Count the days. Count the minutes. Count on being blown away.'_ So what do [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) have in store for us? Could it be a new flat screen iMac? There's some speculation [here](http://www.macslash.com/comments.pl?sid=02%2F01%2F01%2F1514228&cid=&pid=0&startat=&threshold=0&mode=flat&commentsort=0&op=Change). **Update 3.1.02 :** It seems as though Apple are really hyping this up, there's a different tagline for each of the 7 days leading up to the event. Yesterdays was '_Beyond the rumour sites. Way beyond_' and todays is '_It's like a backstage pass to the future_'. As you can imagine, this is sending the [rumour sites](http://www.macrumors.com) into a frenzy of wild speculation.The [iWalk](http://www.spymac.com): An elaborate fake?
