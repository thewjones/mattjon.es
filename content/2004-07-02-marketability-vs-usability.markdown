<blockquote>Apple used to be the king of usability engineering; thinking deep about user behaviors, and making things just work right. This means anticipating needs, making things broadly applicable, and thinking ahead enough that things aren’t constantly changing version to version, because they work well for most people the first time. That’s not the new Apple way; which is quickly slapping marketing features on, that demo well, but aren’t highly usable (for many people).</blockquote>


The rest of [this article](http://www.igeek.com/articles/Interface/Dashboard.txt) isn’t much to write home about, but I think that paragraph is very true in relation to many elements of OS X.
