As you may have gathered, I've had a busy few weeks. You see, I'm the sort of person who can't say no to people when they ask a favour, and when those favours turn out to be major tasks which require quite a bit of time, I begin to regret my kindness. So I took on too much, even to the point where I wasn't getting enough sleep and it felt as though all of my waking hours were spent working. On Friday, the work that had been weighing down on me was finally complete and the feeling of joy at this fact was amplified by celebrating [England's World Cup win against Argentina](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/nigeria_v_england/newsid_2033000/2033290.stm ). I had England down as getting their backsides kicked; happily I was proved wrong.
