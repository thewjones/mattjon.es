I'm feeling a little under-nourished of audio / visual stimuli at the moment. All our stuff is still boxed up in the new flat, waiting until the place is sorted out a bit before we can enjoy the home comforts of television, hi-fi and somewhere to sit down. I suppose it's all part of moving house and I can't expect things to be sorted straight away. I'm grateful for the slightly longer journey to work that living out of town has necessitated as it allows me more time to read; at the moment, I'm reading Paul Auster's latest '[The Book of Illusions](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571212131/ref=sr_aps_books_1_1/202-4637657-2671040)'. Expect a review of sorts when I finish it.
