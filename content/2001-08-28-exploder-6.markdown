Just when you thought the web was on its way to [reaching its full potential](http://www.w3.org/), along comes [Internet Explorer 6](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm). Unless I'm mistaken, IE6 still implements the [CSS box model](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/box.html) incorrectly [Addendum: I'm mistaken, IE6 **does** implement the CSS box model correctly, it just doesn't do CSS Level 2 trickery], and because of their new [auto image resize](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/evaluation/overview/flexible.asp), my technique of using 100% widths for images on this page seems to fail. [Smart tags](http://www.glassdog.com/smarttags/) threatened to take control away from the designer and insert links into web sites without authority. The auto image resize feature is really an extension of this; surely it is up to the designer to create fluid websites which scale properly when the window is resized. Microsoft are selling the browser on 'cool' features such as thisâ€¦ unfortunately, they hinder the designer trying to innovate as well as design for standards compliance. What puzzles me is this: if Microsoft could create an excellent standards compliant browser **2 years ago** with [IE5 Macintosh Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/ie/ie_default.asp), why are they struggling to do the same now with IE6? Something is afoot. So, instead of downloading the latest version of Explorer, I **urge** you to download [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org), [Opera](http://www.opera.com) or [iCab](http://www.icab.de) instead. Change your default browser and stop Microsoft further taking control of the web.
