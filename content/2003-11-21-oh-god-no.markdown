Dr Seuss' classic [The Cat in the Hat](http://www.seussville.com/seussville/) has been turned into a [Christmas Hollywood CGI-fest](http://www.catinthehat.com/) starring Mike Myers. To all parents of young children out there, please buy them the book for Christmas instead of taking them to see the film, they'll get _so_ much more out of it.
