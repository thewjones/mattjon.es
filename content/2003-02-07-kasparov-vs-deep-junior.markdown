[Garry Kasparov](http://www.kasparovchess.com/) is currently playing [Deep Junior](http://www.bkchess.com/Chess_Software/Deep_Junior/deep_junior.html) in the deciding 6th game of the human vs. computer Chess tournament; you can watch live via flash widget [here](http://static.wired.com/news/feature/chess/game.html). When I was studying for my A-Levels, Kasparov played Nigel Short in a tournament televised on [Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com). In the space of a couple of days, the sixth form common room went from a pit of noise and general teenage madness to a hushed arena of contemplation as everyone hunched over their Chess boards. You could forget Nirvana, Sonic Youth and The Smashing Pumpkins, Chess was where it was at.   

Incidentally, [Fark](http://www.fark.com) is offering some [interesting perpectives](http://cgi.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments-voteresults.pl?424899) on the Kasparov/Junior game.  

**Update:** The game ended as a draw. This puzzled the commentators because Kasparov was clearly in a winning position. One explanation is that he had a bad headache and could not continue. I don't blame him really.
