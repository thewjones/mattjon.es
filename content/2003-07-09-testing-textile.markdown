title: Testing Textile

wordpress_id: 705

Just testing out Dean Allen's [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/index.html), a Humane Web Text Generator. Previously, I've been using his [Web Writing Applescripts](http://www.textism.com/resources/index.html?id=9 ) for [Tex-Edit Plus](http://www.tex-edit.com/) to clean up the HTML before publishing it via a web form. Now, I've cut out this extra step by adding the Textile [PHP script](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/beta2.html) to my includes folder so that I can simply call the 'textile' function as the post is submitted to the database. Expect over-zealous use of ordered/unordered lists as I throw 'em in just for the fun of it.
