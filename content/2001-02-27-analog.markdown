Despite the falling price of decent digital cameras, analog photography on the web is still going strong. The sharpness and colour accuracy of transparency film is unbeatable [by current consumer digital cameras], especially if you take pictures with a medium format camera like [Joshua Dunford](http://www.joshuadunford.com/photographics.html) [if you're lucky, you can pick up a second-hand one of these pretty cheaply - my [C330](http://www.photonet.demon.nl/mamiya/c330s/) was 75 Pounds Sterling]. This, coupled with the falling price of quality flatbed [transparency scanners](http://www.jigsaw24.com/proddesc.asp?ITEM=X560ACA) means that you can make images for the web which blow digital images away.
