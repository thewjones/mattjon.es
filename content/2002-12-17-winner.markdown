Demonstrating that pink bubbles do have a place on the web, Tommy Hulme wins the stylesheet [competition](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/article/100). A CD of his choice from [the site](http://www.subsist.org/plink/) will be on its way just in time for Christmas. Thanks again to all who took part.
