I've decided to start posting all of my geeky [OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) entries to Phil's excellent [and very green] new [community blog](http://www.xlab.co.uk/macosx/) dedicated to the new OS. This is to spare those non-OS X users amongst you of entries that you're probably not very interested in. On the other hand, if you do use OS X, be sure head over there and contribute yourself.
