[Herk Harvey's 60's horror classic 'Carnival of Souls' is on the Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/details/CarnivalofSouls)  

Great film. Had a big influence on George Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead', which is also available for [download](http://www.archive.org/details/night_of_the_living_dead)
