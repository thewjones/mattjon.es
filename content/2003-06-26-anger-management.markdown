One of the things I find entertaining about Tennis is the historically icey relationship between the player and umpire; when the put downs and the accusatory insults meet the 'talk to the hand' nonchalance of the person in charge. I watched [Rusedski](http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/bios/ms/atpr237.html) launch his tirade of expletives at the umpire on live television coverage of this years [Wimbledon Tournament](http://www.wimbledon.org) as snickers could be heard from the commentary team. Someone in the crowd had apparently called a shot [Roddick](http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/bios/ms/atpr485.html) had played 'out!' when it was most certainly on the line (chalk flew up!). When play stopped, everyone assumed that a 'let' would be called and the point would have to be played again. When it wasn't and the umpire gave the point to Roddick, Rusedski proceeded to [lose the plot](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/wimbledon_2003/3021744.stm) completely and as a result, lost the game.



	

While Rusedski will never be a Wimbledon winner if he can't control his anger in order to raise his game, at least he shows human characteristics during high-tension televised sport. While those sportspeople who play with absolute efficiency and calmness are the ones who tend to win (with the exception of [McEnroe](http://dir.salon.com/people/bc/2000/07/11/mcenroe/index.html)), they aren't half boring to watch. Rusedski has been criticised and heavily fined for his outburst, but at least he has added a bit of spark to this years tournament.
