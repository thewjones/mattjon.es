[Radiohead](http://www.radiohead.com)'s Kid A has been voted 'album of the year' in a [poll](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_1057000/1057513.stm) of 40 UK music journalists. Funny that, I seem to remember the press giving the album a good slating when it came out.

My god, I haven't bought any music so far this month. I'm resisting the temptation in order to save a few pennies for Christmas frivolities and presents. Looking forward to New Year, I'm celebrating it on the fabulous [Island of Skye](http://www.skye.co.uk/index.html) with 40 other nice people. Can't wait, specially when we all have a quasi-religious experience listening to '[Thus Spake Zarathustra](http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Forum/6370/2001.html)' as we watch the sun rise on Jan 1st, 2001. Original idea huh?
