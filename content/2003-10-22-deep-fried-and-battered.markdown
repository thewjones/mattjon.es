A Fish & Chip shop in Newcastle has added a new seasonal dish to its menu: [battered Christmas Pudding](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3210456.stm). I might have to sample this culinery delight for myself, although, for the purposes of dietary balance, I'll have to go on a strict no-fat diet for a number of weeks before attempting it.
