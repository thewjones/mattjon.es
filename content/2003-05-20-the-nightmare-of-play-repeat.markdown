title: The Nightmare of Play-Repeat

I'm pretty sure that the [repeated playing of Metallica tracks](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3042907.stm) to break the will of Iraqi prisoners of war constitutes torture. There's something so repulsive to the human brain about a single song, looped indefinitely so that particular patterns of sound cause mental anguish, especially when lack of sleep is involved.



	

When I was a student, a housemate came back late one night, slightly intoxicated by alcohol. Unfortunately, the extent of her drunkenness made her put her much liked [Finley Quaye](http://www.finleyquaye.com) CD single on repeat-play before promptly falling asleep for the night. I awoke to the wall-muffled bass lines of 'Even After All' caught in a hellish infinite loop of light reggae.



	

No-one should have to go through that.
