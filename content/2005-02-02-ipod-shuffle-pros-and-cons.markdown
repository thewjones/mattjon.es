title: iPod Shuffle Pros and Cons

The [iPod Shuffle](http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/) was introduced exactly 2 weeks before my partner’s birthday. So, thinking that it would make an ideal present, and allowing for a 2 week delivery time, I ordered one straight away. This isn’t a proper review, neither is a comparison with the big [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) because I don’t own one. Rather, it’s a quick list of pros and cons after a week or so of using it (a bit :).


### Pros





	
  * Very small and light

	
  * No moving parts so it’s impossible to make it skip

	
  * Simple controls mean you can operate it through a layer of clothing, which is useful when out jogging.

	
  * Backwards compatible with my iMac which has USB 1.1, and transfer speed isn’t bad.

	
  * The Autofill feature on iTunes makes it easy to keep the iPod Shuffle full of randomly selected music from your Library.




### Cons





	
  * No [Ogg Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com/) playback (this is always going to be a problem with the iPods for me)

	
  * Slight popping noise between tracks. Not a problem when you’re out and about, but when listening in a quiet room, it’s slightly distracting.

	
  * The supplied headphones aren’t great, but, like the infamous hockey puck mouse, easily replaceable with something better.
