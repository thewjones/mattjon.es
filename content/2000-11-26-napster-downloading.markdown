You know when you download music from [Napster](http://www.napster.com), you have to wait patiently for the song to download before you can play it? Well, [Friskit](http://www.friskit.com) is a new music sharing tool which [streams](http://illinois.online.uillinois.edu/IONresources/streamingMedia/Introduction.html) the mp3s to your computer, so that the music plays [almost] straight away. I haven't checked it out yet, so it might be rubbishâ€¦ sounds pretty interesting anyway though.
