For me, there is one conclusive indicator that David Blaine's [current endurance feat](http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/D/david_blaine/) near Tower Bridge is nothing more than an elaborate illusion: the absence of [Norris McWhirter](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norris_McWhirter) to check that everything is above board. Or maybe his absence can be explained by the fact that he and [Guinness World Records](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/) are simply not impressed with Blaine's antics. Here are some far more impressive endurance records:



	


	
  * [Longest Time Spent in an Attic](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.asp?id=53502): 'Stephan Kovaltchuk spent 57 years in his attic in Montchintsi, Ukraine, emerging in September, 1999.'

		
  * [Longest Full Body Ice Contact Endurance](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.asp?id=56038): 'Wearing only swimming trunks, The Netherlands' Wim Hof was able to endure standing in a tube filled with ice cubes for 66 minutes 4 seconds on the set of Tomorrow's World , at BBC Television Centre, London, UK on March 13, 2002.'

		
  * [Most Squares Crocheted by a Single Person](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.asp?id=53139): 'Susie Perkins of Cottonwood, Arizona, USA, has crocheted more than 14,000 squares over the past 25 years.'
