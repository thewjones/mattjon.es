title: Kasparov vs. X3D Fritz

The first game in the Chess match between [Gary Kasparov and X3D Fritz](http://www.x3dchess.com/) has ended in a draw. The human vs. machine chess matches are always interesting, although the sponsorship from 3D Technology company [X3D](http://www.x3d.com) has given the match a strange twist: Kasparov has to play the match wearing [3D glasses](http://www.x3dchess.com/technology.htm). I'm not sure whether this is supposed to help Kasparov or it's a handicap for the Chess Grandmaster. 



	

Apparently, he gets to watch [Jaws 3-D](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085750/) in the lunch break.
