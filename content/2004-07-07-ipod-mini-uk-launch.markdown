The [iPod Mini](http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/) is to be [launched in the UK](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3874347.stm) on the 24th of July. Here’s me thinking that it had been launched in the UK ages ago, hence a number of fruitless ‘window shopping’ visits to [John Lewis’](http://www.johnlewis.com/default.asp?CK=true).
