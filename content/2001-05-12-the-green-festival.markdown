A small percentage of my bank holiday weekend was spent at [The Green Festival](http://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/festivals.pl?FestID=143) -  a very small version of [Glastonbury](http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/) in a park in the city centre of Newcastle [yes, that small]. It's great because as you sit in the middle of a clump of trees listening to some nice folky music, you can pretend you're at some kind of festival in the middle of the countryside [like er.. Glastonbury] which is all well and good until you look up and see [St James' Park](http://www.nufc.co.uk/) towering above like something from the set of '[Close Encounters](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0075860)...'.
