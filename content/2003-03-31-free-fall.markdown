At the end of April, I'm leaving my current place of work. It feels like I'm jumping off a sturdy diving board into a deep swirling pool of uncertainty; either that or I'm up a certain creek without propulsion. Regardless of the fear factor, it's a challenge I'm rather looking forward to. I'm going to do what I'm most passionate about which is to teach, mainly in the field of creativity/art/design with computers. I'm also looking for freelance work in photography, web design and copywriting. So, on the slim chance that you require any work to be done along those lines (yes, I know most of you are photographers and/or web designers and/or writers anyway but there's no harm in trying is there?) [let me know](http://www.ballofstringtheory.com/contact/).
