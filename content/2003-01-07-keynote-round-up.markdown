Here is a round-up of Apple's Keynote speech at Macworld, San Francisco.  



  


  * [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/imovie/), [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) and [iPhoto](http://www.apple.com/iphoto/) are still free, although they can be bought as a bundle with [iDVD](http://www.apple.com/idvd/) called [iLife](http://www.apple.com/ilife/) for $49.
  


  * [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) is an Apple browser based on the [KHTML Rendering Engine](http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/kdeqt/kde3arch/khtml/) which seems very cool, although I'm not a fan of the brushed metal look.
  


  * Another Microsoft killer is [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/safari/), a Powerpoint-like app for creating presentations. Again, I think this is going to be a great product.
  


  * A [17 Inch PowerBook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html) with a fibre-optic lit keyboardâ€¦  nice!
  


  * A [12 Inch PowerBook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index12.html)... hmm. I'm not quite sure what the market is for this product. If you want the speed of a G4 PowerBook, then surely you would want a big screen to use your power-hungry apps on, otherwise a cheaper iBook would suffice.
  


  * No 'digital lifestyle device' as yet, but it seems Apple are moving away from the desktop machine. It will only be a matter of time before a PDA is announced or the PowerBook becomes so small it will fit in your pocket!
