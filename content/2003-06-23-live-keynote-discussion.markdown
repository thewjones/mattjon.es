Macrumors.com are offering a [customised IRC client](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?threadid=28954) for updates during the [Apple Keynote at WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/). For those missing the usual live Quicktime stream ([a stream is being broadcast after the Keynote ends](http://stream.apple.akadns.net/)), it's the second best option for live information from the event.



	

After downloading the client, simply type a username and you will be automatically connected to the #macrumors channel. My username is 'mattj'.
