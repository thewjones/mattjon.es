I especially like the Countdown video at [hexstatic](http://www.hexstatic.co.uk/). It cheered me right up this morning [for non-UK readers, [Countdown](http://www.channel4.co.uk/entertainment/countdown/) is a daytime-TV word-play show hosted by the one and only Richard Whiteley. It launched the legendary [Channel 4](http://www.channel4.com) and attracts millions of viewers each day, more than any other Channel 4 program].
