[More details](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2079307) of the forthcoming Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy film are emerging; as well the news that [Martin Freeman](http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0293509/) is to play Arthur Dent, hip-hop artist [Mos Def](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0080049/) is to play Ford Prefect, [Zooey Deschanel](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0221046/) is to play Trillian and [Bill Nighy](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0631490/) is to play Slartibartfast. I really hope the producers do a good job of translating Douglas Adams' work for the big screen, although my fear is that much of the dry humour and personality that Adams injected into his work will be lost as Hollywood applies its thick coating of gloss to the story. The fact that screenwriter [Karey Kirkpatrick](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0456732/) has re-written Adams' screenplay does not bode well.
