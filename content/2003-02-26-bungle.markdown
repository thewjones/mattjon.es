Derek Bond, the 72 year old pensioner arrested at gunpoint by the FBI in connection with a multi-million dollar telemarketing scam, has been [set free](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2799791.stm). I can't believe the FBI thought Bond and Sykes were the same person, I mean the difference in the shape of their noses is a bit of a giveaway isn't it? Unless of course they thought Bond/Sykes was a master of disguise on a par with [Inspector Clouseau](http://inspectorclouseau.com/d_quasi.html).
