[Hyperscape 1](http://access.lowtech.org/events/hyperscape/) is an installation using 10 networked [Mac Classics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Classic) running [Hypercard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercard).

> The HyperCard program simply creates a list of variables and passes this list as a single variable to each of the other computers. On receipt of a new set of variables the other macs then draw on the same information as the controller, but with a 1 in 10 chance of deciding not to.
