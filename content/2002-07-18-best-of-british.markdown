The Guardian have launched a competition for the [best British weblog](http://www.guardian.co.uk/weblog/bestbritishblog/0,12252,756320,00.html). What is this? Crufts? There is no model for the ultimate blog; by their very nature, they are a means of communicating something to who ever wants to read it; a blog may be badly written and badly designed, but if it communicates something to someone on any level, then it has made an achievement. I sympathise with the judging panel; they're going have a tough time deciding between the hundreds of submitted blogs, if they're going to assess each one fairly that is.
