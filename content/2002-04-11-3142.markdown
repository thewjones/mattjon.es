I bought Darren Aronofsky's film [π](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0138704) as part of an impulse '2 for 1' purchase at Virgin yesterday. There are some films you can buy on DVD where you feel secure in the knowledge that the film is good enough to own, that you can watch it repeatedly and still get something out if it; well π isn't one of them. It's certainly an interesting film, and the visuals are striking, but I'm not sure it's worth buying.
