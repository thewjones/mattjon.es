Thanks to [The Slashdot Effect](http://ssadler.phy.bnl.gov/adler/SDE/SlashDotEffect.html) and the need for an online database of books to go alongside [imdb.com](http://www.imdb.com) and [allmusic.com](http://www.allmusic.com), the [Internet Book List](http://www.iblist.com) is set to be a hugely popular website. Unfortunately, the Slashdot linkage has meant that most of the books added to the database so far reflect the reading habits of the Slashdot demographic; there's plenty of Science Fiction and Fantasy on there and little else. Hopefully, the balance of genres will even itself out in time; in fact it will have to if this is going to be a valuable resource of book information.
