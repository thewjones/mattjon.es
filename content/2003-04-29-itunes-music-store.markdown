It was inevitable that music downloads would have to start being paid for; thankfully, with the [iTunes Music Store](http://www.apple.com/music/store/), Apple have made the process of parting with cash in exchange for MP3/AAC encoded music as painless as possible. It will be interesting to see how the downloads are priced when the service becomes available in the UK.
