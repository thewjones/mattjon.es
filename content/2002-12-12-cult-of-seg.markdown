The [Segway HT](http://www.segway.com) has its first fan site; Phillip M. Torrone commutes on his every day and has created a [website](http://www.bookofseg.com/diaries/index.html ) to document his experiences. In my previous post, I discussed the personification of Apple Computers; at least you don't get a [birth certificate](http://www.bookofseg.com/diaries/IMG_2102_JPG.html) when you purchase a Mac.
