I'm in the process of a much needed clean up of code in order to sharpen things up a bit round here. It's a live transition so expect things to change further over the next few days. I've added a 'Popular Posts' section on the right-hand side of the page. This was inspired by [Signal vs. Noise](http://www.37signals.com/svn/) who have a similar section on their site. I thought it would be interesting to sort posts by something other than the time at which they were posted; it also keeps active threads visible, which is handy.
