<blockquote>_If you buy into a proprietary platform where the music industry gets a veto, you’re scr0d. Every time you buy an iPod, you are financing legal and technical countermeasures aimed at taking away legitimate features that enable you to do more with your lawfully acquired music and hardware._</blockquote>
