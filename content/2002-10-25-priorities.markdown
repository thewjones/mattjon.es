I'm thinking of getting a permanent web connection to my new place and I need some advice on negotiating the minefield that is [ADSL](http://www.bt.com/broadband_information/index.html) vs. [Cable](http://www.blueyonder.co.uk/) etc. Who offers the best deals and service? If I choose ADSL, is it best to buy an ADSL modem seperately, or get everything through a BT package? Are there any known problems with setting up ADSL modems on OS X? What are the advantages of Cable apart from more choice of bad television?
