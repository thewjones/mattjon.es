It seems as though [Pyra](http://www.pyra.com) has [fallen foul](http://www.evhead.com/longer/2200706_essays.asp) of the dotcom recession and is in serious financial trouble. What I don't understand is this: surely there is such a large user-base that as soon as a pay-for 'pro' version of [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) is released, there is the potential to make the company very profitable. There is enough interest out there in keeping the web rich in hyperlinked content; there are enough individuals passionate enough about what they have to say, that I would have thought Pyra would have been able to harness the blogging craze they have helped to build up. Soâ€¦ it seems Blogger is now a [one man band](http://www.evhead.com/longer/2200706_essays.asp).  Good luck [Ev](http://www.evhead.com), that's what I say.
