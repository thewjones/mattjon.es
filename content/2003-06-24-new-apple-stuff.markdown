* [iChat AV](http://www.apple.com/ichat/) - The ability to audio / video chat as easily as this is a major advancement in the way we communicate using the internet. Disappointingly however, video conferencing only works on G4 machines and faster, meaning those using [iBooks](http://www.apple.com/ibook/) and older iMacs with G3 processors will miss out on this feature. If anyone wants to try out the audio chat, my username is **systemattic**. Although as I just found out when chatting to [Rik](http://www.mememachine.net), I don't think the internal mic on my iMac is working too well, so you'll probably just hear me shouting.



	

  * [Panther](http://www.apple.com/macosx/panther/) (most notably, the new [Finder](http://www.apple.com/macosx/panther/finder.html), [Fast User Switching](http://www.apple.com/macosx/panther/fast_user_switching.html) and [Expose](http://www.apple.com/macosx/panther/expose.html)) - I'll wait until get to use it before I write about it, but from what I can tell, the new features look great. Still not convinced about the new Finder, but I guess I'll have to wait and see.



	

  * [G5](http://www.apple.com/powermac/) - "The fastest personal computer in world". So, no more Wintel users going on about how the fastest Macs are sluggish compared to their machines. Still it hasn't stopped Jack Schofield from having [an axe to grind](http://www.onlineblog.com/archives/2003_06_22_onlineblog_archive.html#105642458426883215).
