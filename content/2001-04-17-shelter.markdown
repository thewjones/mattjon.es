Spent most of the easter break sheltering from the wintery weather that usually pervades the Northeast of England in the middle of April. The highlight of the weekend was watching [Autechre](http://www.autechre.nu/) play on Saturday. Hunched behind a couple Powerbook G3s and a mass of wires and noise making machines, they play music that's difficult to describe. It's also very difficult to dance to, which I felt slightly confused the usual clubbing crowd there… one of the reasons I like their stuff so much. ::. I walk past this [vicious public convenience](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/18312.html) everyday on my way to work… it's obviously not very happy in its job of serving the needs of desperate shoppers.
