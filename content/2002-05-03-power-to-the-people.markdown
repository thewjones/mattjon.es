Mr Allen of Textism [needs your help](http://www.textism.com/article/505/) in an act of retaliation on behalf of [Leslie Harpold](http://leslie.harpold.com/), who - as a result of complete inconsideration by [Verisign](http://www.textism.com/article/494/) - had her hoopla.com domain name taken away from her. This link to '[Verisign](http://www.textism.com/article/494/)' ought to do it.
