Damnâ€¦ got work coming out of my ears at the moment which means I have to work over the Easter holiday to get it done. Definitely going to see [Autechre](http://www.autechre.nu/) live on Saturday night though, which should be mighty fine. ::: This years entries for the [5k Competition](http://www.the5k.org/) are up - I'm sure there'll be a few gems in there somewhere.
