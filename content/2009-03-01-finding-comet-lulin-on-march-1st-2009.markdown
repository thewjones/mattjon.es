These are instructions on how to find Comet Lulin on the 1st of March 2009. To find it, look to the north and find The Plough. Draw a line between the stars that form the start of the dip and extend the line until you see the next brightest star, which is Regulus. Just up from Regulus at the 1 o'clockÂ  position, you'll see Comet Lulin. It's past its brightest point as it moves away from the Sun, so you'll need very good conditions to have a chance of seeing it.
