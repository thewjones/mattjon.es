Apologies for the interruptions in service. I've been pulling my hair out trying to set up a network router for most of the day. It's a relatively old [Netgear](http://www.netgear.com) RP114 I picked up cheaply on [eBay](http://www.ebay.co.uk) at the weekend. It's a nice piece of kit, although getting the dern thing to work is proving to be more difficult than it should.
