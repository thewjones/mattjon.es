It/Ginger, the mysterious and world changing invention by Dean Kamen has been uncovered. It is a hydrogen fueled 2-wheeled [scooter](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/03-06-2001/0001441589&EDATE=) - "the first generation of a new mode  

       of transportation that will compete with and possibly replace  

       automobiles". [This article](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/03-06-2001/0001441589&EDATE=) also cites Kamen's 'Stirling Engine' as being "an almost  perpetual motion machine". Well I'll be.
