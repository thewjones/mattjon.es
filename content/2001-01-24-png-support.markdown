So when is [IE5/Win](www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm) going to have full support for [PNG](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/) (Portable Network Graphic) files? This format is far superior to the common [GIF](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/G/GIF.html) format because it generates smaller file sizes, renders more quickly on browsers and supports neato tricks like alpha transparency [which means you can create fancy 'see-through' graphics]. At the moment, PNG is the graphic format of choice for [Flash](http://www.macromedia.com/flash/) developers as the Flash plugin has full support for this format. But for non-flash web designers, it's not looking too good. Whereas [Netscape 6](http://home.netscape.com)* [for all platforms] and [IE5/Mac](www.microsoft.com/mac/ie/default.htm) does have full support for PNG, [IE5/Win](www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm) doesn't - which means it will be a long time before PNG has its day [and it's been waiting for about 4 years].

*OKâ€¦ so Netscape 6 is particularly bug-ridden, but in my opinion, it is the second best browser out there after IE5/Mac.
