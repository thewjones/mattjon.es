[Here's the video](http://homepage.mac.com/systemattic/iMovieTheater3.html) I made for the BA Fashion Marketing course (on which I teach) and displayed at [Graduate Fashion Week](http://www.gfw.org.uk/) in London. My brief was to showcase the students work in a short piece to be shown at the front of the exhibition space. The music, by [Goldfrapp](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Goldfrapp), skillfully mixes [Donna Summer](http://www.warr.org/summer.html)-like vocals with [Kraftwerk](http://www.kraftwerk.com)-like instrumentals and seems to sum up the 80s influence on this years work perfectly. The footage that isn't studio based is video work created by the students themselves. The video requires [Quicktime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/) and is 9 MB in size.
