Like most people, I have a shopping list of things I would like to buy if I had some spare cash; this consists mainly of electronic consumables [the [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/), the [G4 Powerbook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/), the [Digital IXUS](http://www.digital-ixus.com/index2.html) etc], but there's also non-digital items in there as well, the latest being this: [The Big Briar Etherwave Theremin](http://www.bigbriar.com/cgi-local/SoftCart.100.exe/spec/ewav.html?L+scstore+fckk7384ff703f70+1034488929). Why? Well, after listening to '[Theremin Noir](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Alp7uak1k0m3x)' by Rob Schwimmer, Uri Caine and Mark Feldman, you'd want one as well. Many of the tracks are rearrangements of [Bernard Herrman](http://www.uib.no/People/midi/soundtrackweb/herrmann/)'s score for [Vertigo](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0052357), with piano and violin accompaniment. I think the Theremin is widely considered to be a silly device which made eerie noises for early horror films, but this album demonstrates that it is actually a beautiful sounding instrument to be taken more seriously.
