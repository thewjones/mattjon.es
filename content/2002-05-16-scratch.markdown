I love record players. As a youngster I used to have fun playing records at the wrong speed or playing them backwards; it was really about making something new from the music. Last night, I went to a gig entitled [Turntable Hell](http://www.cmntours.org.uk/tours/turntablehell/), in which eight musicians - each armed with home-made turntables, gramophones, cheap sixties portables and an array sound mangling units  - sat and made noise by hitting, cutting, scratching and warping their collection of vinyl. Some of it was so difficult to listen to that people ran out with their fingers in their ears. I've been to a few avant-garde gigs before, and to be honest I find much of it boring and pretentious, but I really enjoyed this gig. I enjoyed its playfulness, its ridiculousness and I don't think it took itself too seriously. Here are the [tour dates](http://www.cmntours.org.uk/tours/turntablehell/dates.html).
