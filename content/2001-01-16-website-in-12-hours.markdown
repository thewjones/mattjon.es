I've got 12 hours to teach a group of photography students on how to get a website up and running. Bearing in mind that most of them know little about web design [or computers in general for that matter], I think it's going to be pretty difficult in the time I've got. I'm tempted to teach them how to create and maintain a [weblog](http://www.blogger.com) which would compliment an online folio of photography work. This would not only teach them the basics of [HTML](http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/) and FTP etc., but also, I think it would help to enthuse them about online culture in general and the importance of keeping a website fresh with content.
