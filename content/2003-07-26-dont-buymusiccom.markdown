title: Don't BuyMusic.com

This week saw the launch of [BuyMusic.com](http://www.buymusic.com), a music download service in direct competition with the [iTunes Music Store](http://www.apple.com/music/store/). However, initial reports about it are negative and here are a few reasons why, if you're a Windows user, you may want to wait until the Windows version of the iTunes Music Store becomes available:



      


  
  * The site is **only** accessible to Internet Explorer running on Windows

           
  * Your rights to the music you've bought are restricted as your licence to make copies of songs varies depending on the record company the music is from

         
  * Downloaded songs can't be played on an [iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/)

           
  * The songs are in Windows Media Format

                
  * The advertising campaign is a rip-off of Apple's, which shows a complete lack of originality and innovation. 

          
  * The site is, apparently, buggy
