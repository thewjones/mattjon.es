What do you get if you cross the 1980s classic [Acornsoft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acornsoft) game [Elite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_%28computer_game%29) with [Grand Theft Auto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas)? A game called '[The Outsider](http://www.frontier.co.uk/outsider/)', by [David Braben](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Braben). 


	

At first it seems impossible to liken these two games; one a relatively slow-paced first-person space trading game with primitive (by today's technology anyway) graphics, and the other a violent third-person thuggery simulator.


	

But then you remember that just as you can wreak havoc and then suffer the consequences by having a load of police on your tail in Grand Theft Auto, you could do exactly the same thing in Elite; and the more you think about it, the more similarities these two games have. 


	

So, The Outsider is a game that seems graphically similar to GTA, but will be bring gameplay elements of Elite into the fold. The character you play is even called 'Jameson'.
