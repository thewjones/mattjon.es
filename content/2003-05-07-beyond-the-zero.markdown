In 1994, my English Literature tutor gave me a battered copy of Thomas Pynchon's [Gravity's Rainbow](http://www.hyperarts.com/pynchon/gravity/index.html). Nine years later, I'm still trying to get through it. While reading it is like beating your way through thick jungle growth to find a path, the process of doing so is made enjoyable by Pynchon's incredible use of language.
