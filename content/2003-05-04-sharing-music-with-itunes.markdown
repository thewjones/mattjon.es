[iTunes'](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) new music sharing feature is very cool indeed. After enabling sharing from behind a firewall in the system preferences - as documented in [this](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107547&SaveKCWindowURL=http%3A%2F%2Fkbase.info.apple.com%2Fcgi-bin%2FWebObjects%2Fkbase.woa%2Fwa%2FSaveKCToHomePage&searchMode=Assisted&kbhost=kbase.info.apple.com&showButton=false&randomValue=100&showSurvey=false&sessionID=anonymous%7C169684450) Knowledge Base article - [Kev](http://www.sorehead.org/redbook/) and I were able to view each others playlists and stream music remotely with ease. Sharing options can be found in the iTunes preferences and if you know the IP address of a shared playlist, you can connect to it in the iTunes Advanced menu. [Let me know](contact/) if you would like to share some music.
