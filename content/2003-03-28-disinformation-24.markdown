Last Wednesday, it was [widely reported](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2889635.stm) that Allied fighter jets were attacking a column of between 70 and 120 tanks apparently on a suicide mission heading south from Basra. Geoff Hoon later gave a press conference in which he admitted that there were, in fact, **3** tanks on the move. When reports from Iraq can be as spectacularly inaccurate as this, is there any point in following the news?
