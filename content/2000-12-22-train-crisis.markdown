The so called '[train crisis](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1068000/1068772.stm)' in the UK is really not as bad as the media is making out. I travelled from Newcastle to Crewe [a 4 hour journey requiring 2 changes of train] without any problems at all. In fact, the trains were completely empty [in the run up to Christmas!?].  

   

  

As a result of my slightly hectic lifestyle, travelling is the only opportunity I get to have a good think and develop some ideas. During yesterdays journey, I had a good idea for a novel I will never write, and I made some plans for a few personal new media projects I wouldn't mind getting off the ground.
