I usually avoid going to see blockbuster movies on the day they're released. I prefer a quiet cinema, where there aren't kids throwing popcorn at the back of your head, or people persistantly talking in front. However, I think I might go and see [Lord of the Rings](http://www.lordoftherings.net/index_flat.html) on Wednesday when it's released in cinemas across much of the globe. It would be good to soak up the atmosphere of a packed audience enjoying what seems to be - from initial reviews - a great filmâ€¦ or maybe I shouldn't believe the hype.
