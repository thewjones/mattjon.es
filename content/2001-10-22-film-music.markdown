There's so many good films and albums being released at the moment. Go and see [Amelie](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0211915) if you haven't do so already. Other films to look forward to are The Coen Brother's latest, [The Man Who Wasn't There](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0243133) [[view trailer](http://www.themanwhowasntthere.com/trailer/themanT1.mov )] and the film that sees David Lynch's return to weirdness [Mulholland Drive](http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0166924). An album I'm particularly looking forward to is a new release by Hope Sandoval [of [Mazzy Star](http://www.themanwhowasntthere.com/trailer/themanT1.mov )] entitled [Bavarian Fruit Bread](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Q590/o/qid=/sr=8-1/ref=sr_aps_pm_1_1/202-0615421-5411057).
