        <h1>Review: The Royal Tenenbaums</h1>
      </header>
      <p>This film is both a comedy and a bleak portrayal of
      depression; about that fuzzy line between genius and madness.
      The story follows the father, Royal Tenenbaum [<a href=
      "http://us.imdb.com/Name?Hackman,+Gene">Gene Hackman</a>], as
      he attempts to right some wrongs and get back together with
      his family. The prodigious children - one a playwrite, one a
      successful businessman and the other a champion tennis player
      - have grown up twisted by their own genius. The playwrite
      daughter Margot [<a href=
      "http://us.imdb.com/Name?Paltrow,+Gwyneth">Gwyneth
      Paltrow</a>], spends all day in the bathtub watching a
      portable TV which is secured to the wall so it doesn’t fall
      in the water. Chas [<a href=
      "http://us.imdb.com/Name?Stiller,+Ben">Ben Stiller</a>],
      successful businessman and widower, brings up his two
      children to be just like his track-suit clad neurotic self.
      Richie [<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Wilson,+Luke">Luke
      Wilson</a>] spends all his time hanging around on cruise
      ships, having been a world champion tennis player who has
      spectacularly flown off the rails. Perhaps the sanest member
      of the family is the mother, Ethel [<a href=
      "http://us.imdb.com/Name?Huston,+Anjelica">Anjelica
      Huston</a>], she’s the one trying to keep the balance in the
      family, but she is also a victim of the madness surrounding
      her. The soundtrack includes the song ‘Fly’ by <a href=
      "http://www.algonet.se/~iguana/DRAKE/DRAKE.html">Nick
      Drake</a>. Drake was a reclusive figure who died as a result
      of depression, he is also posthumously hailed as a genius.
      Chas’ pet dog is called ‘Buckley’, and I can’t help but think
      that this is in reference to <a href=
      "http://www.timbuckley.com/">Tim Buckley</a>, a
      singer/songwriter who’s life/death was just as
      inspired/tragic as that of Drake. The Royal Tenenbaums is a
      film about what genius does to the self; it’s a comedy in the
      same way that <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0073486">One
      Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest</a> is a comedy, we find humour
      in other peoples’ illness. I think the team of writer and
      director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson (who plays
      Eli Cash in the film) are a partnership to look out for. I
      haven’t seen their previous films <a href=
      "http://us.imdb.com/Title?0128445">Rushmore</a> or <a href=
      "http://us.imdb.com/Title?0115734">Bottle Rocket</a>, but I
      want to now.</p>
