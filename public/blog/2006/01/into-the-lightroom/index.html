        <h1>Into the Lightroom</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Last year, Apple launched <a href=
      "http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a>, an image
      management tool aimed at professional photographers. Just as
      Apple had introduced <a href=
      "http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/finalcutpro/">Final Cut
      Pro</a> DV editing software to compete with <a href=
      "http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/main.html">Adobe
      Premier</a>, many expected Apple to launch an image
      manipulation application to give Photoshop a run for its
      money on OS X. So people were quick to assume that Aperture
      was Apple’s answer to Photoshop, leading to many <a href=
      "http://www.aperturetricks.com/aperturereviews.htm">negative
      reviews</a> with Aperture apparently lacking many of the
      features of Photoshop.</p>
      <p>Aperture may a share a handful of features with Photoshop,
      but image manipulation is not its main purpose. It is a tool
      to manage the workflow of digital images, using RAW as its
      native file format. Therefore, it was wrong to criticise
      Aperture on the basis that it is an image manipulation tool.
      Other points of criticism included that it is over-priced,
      and that its system requirements are far too high. Having
      never used the software, I wouldn’t like to comment on
      whether it offers value for money or not. But then, I would
      like to be able to use the software on my Mac Mini, so in my
      opinion, criticism over its system requirements is valid.</p>
      <p>Today’s news is that Adobe have introduced a similar
      application called <a href=
      "http://labs.macromedia.com/technologies/lightroom/">Lightroom</a>,
      and they have been very smart about how they are launching
      it. You can download a <a href=
      "http://labs.macromedia.com/technologies/lightroom/">free
      beta</a> version of the software, allowing photographers to
      give feedback so that Adobe can improve the software before
      its official release in the summer. They’ve chosen a great
      name too, Lightroom being the digital version of the old
      chemical darkroom (In fact, maybe Lightroom should have been
      the name for Photoshop?). Best of all, Lightroom doesn’t have
      the ridiculous system requirements Apple have recommended
      with Aperture, so it should be useable on my Mac.</p>
      <p>Although it seems support for my Nikon D70 isn’t quite
      there yet – Adobe still have to work around the nasty white
      balance encryption Nikon have put into there NEF file format
      – I’m going to follow this software with interest. I just
      hope that it is reasonably priced when it’s launched.</p>
