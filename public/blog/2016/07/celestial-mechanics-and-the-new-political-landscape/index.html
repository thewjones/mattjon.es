        <h1>Celestial mechanics and the new political
        landscape</h1>
      </header>
      <p>In 2013 <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_ISON">Comet ISON</a>, a
      frozen lump of dust and gas about 1 kilometre in diameter was
      falling towards the sun. Known as a ‘sungrazing’ comet,
      ISON’s orbit meant that its 3 million year journey from the
      outer solar system would end in a perilous encounter with our
      Star, and no-one knew if it would survive.</p>
      <p>On November 28 that year, the <a href=
      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcROVqmF9SY">comet reached
      perihelion</a> - its closest point to the Sun - and
      astronomers waited to see what came round the other side.
      Something did emerge, but it wasn’t the comet, it was just a
      remnant of it, fizzing out as the tidal forces and heat from
      the Sun pulverised it.</p>
      <p>I think what just happened to the political landcape in
      the UK is a bit like that comet. If the comet, on its long
      approach to the Sun, represented the political status quo,
      then its uncertain encounter and subsequent annihilation
      represents the political chaos that we’re now
      experiencing.</p>
      <p>I believe the only thing that can provide any sense of
      hope for the future of our political system is complete
      <a href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/">electoral
      reform</a>.</p>
      <p>At the root of the problem is the our First-past-the-post
      system of electing government; it means that a Party can hold
      a majority with a relatively small share of votes cast across
      a few marginal seats. This is the reason why people feel so
      disenfranchised, and why parties feel they have to do the
      bidding of the popular press to get into power.</p>
      <p>The attempt by the PLP to remove Jeremy Corbyn and move
      the Labour Party back to the centre ground in order to win
      power is merely addressing a symptom of the problem. Even if
      the Blairite side of the party are successful and we get a
      more right-wing Labour Party in power, a large section of the
      electorate are going to feel as underrepresented as they do
      under the centre-right Government we have now.</p>
      <p>So, let’s have a truly representative Government, one in
      which no single party has overall control and is made up of
      broad coalitions that represent the full political spectrum
      of the electorate. The prospect of parties on the political
      extremes gaining more power as a result would be bitter pill
      to swallow, but in my opinion, worth it if more people vote
      and feel engaged in politics.</p>
      <p>For a new form of Government, we’ll need a new building.
      Let’s vacate the crumbling Houses of Parliament and
      commission a new beautiful building for our representatives
      to assemble in, with a chamber that encourages cooperation
      across party lines - not the confrontational two-sided design
      of the Lower House.</p>
      <p>Finally, I’m not sure where the matter of the possible
      break up of the Union fits in to all this; I prefer the
      status quo as far as this is concerned. There’s speculation
      about the emergence of the UK as a federal state but I’ll
      leave that to another post.</p>
      <p>Join me next time when I attempt to use a Supernova
      collapsing into a Black Hole as a metaphor for what’s just
      happened to the Labour Party.</p>
