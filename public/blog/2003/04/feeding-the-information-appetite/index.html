    <h1>Feeding the Information Appetite</h1>

  <p>It never occurred to me that the World Wide Web was a mere twinkle in Tim Berners Lee&rsquo;s eye during last Gulf war; the Web plays such a huge part in my life that I have trouble remembering how I got my fill of news without it. Being 15 at the time, I could probably think of better things to do than consume the latest on George Bush Snr&rsquo;s campaign against Saddam. I&rsquo;m certain that there was no blanket coverage of the war on TV (on the four terrestrial channels in the UK anyway); but that&rsquo;s not to say that the 1991 Gulf War wasn&rsquo;t a turning point in the whole War / Media relationship. Shortly after the war ended, <a href="http://www.royharper.com/biog.html">Roy Harper</a> wrote a song called &lsquo;The War Came Home Tonight&rsquo; in which he addresses the issue of our experience of war via television. Twelve years later, <a href="http://pesenki.by.ru/internat/harperroy/songs/620.shtml?lg=en">the lyrics</a> of this song seem to be even more relevent; the war comes home when the people who are reporting it to us <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2921807.stm">get attacked</a>; when blood, fresh from the cameraman&rsquo;s wounded face, transgresses the TV medium by dripping onto the lens and seemingly onto the the glass of the screen. I agree with <a href="http://www.malross.co.uk">Mal</a>, amid the confusion and the misinformation broadcast on TV, this is an image that will endure.</p>

<p>Unlike the war 12 years ago, we now have the web to aid us in our desire for information. According to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2914511.stm">this BBC interview </a> with <a href="http://www.useit.com">Jakob Nielsen</a>, a result of this is that we are now &lsquo;desk-chair generals&rsquo;. Nielsen suggests that the web is a better medium for gathering information about the War because the content is more focused and in a form that is easier to digest. I&rsquo;d take this a step further by suggesting that web based news has to be like this for the simple reason of archiving. If <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk">BBC News Online</a> produced breaking news that is speculative and potentially innaccurate, any future search on the site would result in false information. Twenty-four hour news coverage on television seems to be a different matter; while news reports from the front-line can be edited and checked before being broadcast, news readers rely on unsubstantiated information for the purposes of filling air time. I tuned in to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_news_24/default.stm">BBC News 24</a> over the weekend and on more than one occassion, news was broken and not followed up; it&rsquo;s like a cat pouncing on its inanimate prey only to sidle off a second later in disinterest. When the US Army entered the outskirts of Baghdad on Saturday, watching News 24 was a frustrating experience; news reports contradicted each other and the lack of solid information about the unfolding events was clearly frustrating for the news readers as well.</p>

<p>I think the web is a place for much more considered news and analysis about the War in Iraq, but I suppose it can only be left up to the reader to filter out the truth from the misinformation.</p>
