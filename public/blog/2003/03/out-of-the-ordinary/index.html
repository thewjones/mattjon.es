    <h1>Out of the Ordinary</h1>

  <p>The adage &lsquo;write from experience&rsquo; could be considered good advice to those who maintain a weblog. However if, like me, your daily experiences are based upon a routine of mundane activities - which consist mainly of commute, work, commute, sleep and so on - then you may be forgiven for thinking that writing from these experiences would make for rather dull reading. Lifting experiences out of life&rsquo;s flux and publishing them as words is a challenge I enjoy; furthermore, it is an approach that can be applied to the activity of publishing images to the web.</p>

<p>A number of years ago, when I started studying and practicing photography, a tutor said something to me so inspirational that barely a day goes by that I don&rsquo;t think about it. What he said was this: at any one time, everywhere around you are infinite possibilities for making images. At the time, I remember looking out of the window and seeing a car park and some trees and being pretty unimpressed with the choice of photographic opportunities on offer. But it wasn&rsquo;t long before I adjusted to the idea that photography didn&rsquo;t have to be about taking your camera to an object worthy of being photographed; it&rsquo;s also possible to tease interesting images out of the extremely commonplace.</p>

<p>Modern mobile devices give us the ability to publish images of events witnessed at first hand, an activity known as <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0114939/outlines/moblog.html">moblogging</a>. On occasion these events will be news worthy, presenting new opportunities for gathering and publishing evidence of such events, but these occasions are rare; mostly, the mobile communications device will be at hand only to record the ordinariness of life. For me, this is potentially the most exciting aspect of moblogging; to resist the temptation of the &lsquo;photo-op&rsquo; and instead point the camera at the shapes and textures that constitute our environment.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that the coming together of the camera and wireless technology will impact on the medium of photography on a scale similar to that seen when <a href="http://www.kodak.com">Kodak</a> popularised photography with their affordable compact cameras at the start of the 20th Century. We will have to wait and see.</p>
