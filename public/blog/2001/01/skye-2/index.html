        <h1>Skye 2</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Just got back from spending New Year on the <a href=
      "http://www.skye.co.uk/">Island of Skye</a>. Due to some
      tricky driving conditions and some poor navigating on my
      part, it took us a grueling 9 hours to get there, but it was
      [mostly] worth it. My only disappointment is that we didn’t
      see enough of the island, we just didn’t have enough time.
      Well actually, there was plenty of time, but we’re such an
      unorganised bunch that by the time we’d faffed around with
      breakfast, then sat around for a bit… then finally managed to
      put our walking boots on, it seemed to go dark (about
      2.30pm). We needed someone there to say ‘<em>Right. Tomorrow,
      everyone is going to arise at 9pm, eat breakfast then spend
      the rest of the day walking</em>’. Unfortunately for us
      though, there wasn’t anyone as organised as this and we ended
      up doing very little. Although we did - rather drunkenly - go
      sledging down the steep garden at the front of the hostel…
      which was fun, it even had a ‘jump’ half way down which
      caused many sore arses. New Years Eve/Day was spent partying
      all night although I was disappointed that I didn’t quite
      make it to watch the sun rise on the dawn of <a href=
      "http://uk.imdb.com/Title?0062622">2001</a>… it was rubbish
      anyway apparently [very overcast and dreary] :). The return
      journey was 2 hours quicker than the outward one because we
      realised that going through <a href=
      "http://www.timeout.com/glasgow/">Glasgow</a> is much faster
      than going round it… plus it was great to see the fabulous
      Highlands of Scotland (which we missed on the outward journey
      because we travelled through the night). It was a good trip,
      I just wish we used our time there more effectively.
      Ne’ermind.</p>
      <p>Anyway, Happy New Millennium!</p>
