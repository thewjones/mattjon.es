        &gt; &gt; [Lomography](http://www.lomo.com/) is the least
        intellectual pursuit you can imagine. You can't work it out
        or plan what you are going to do ahead, you can only feel
        it and do it. " - from 'What the hell is Lomo?', the
        introductory booklet accompanying the Lomo Camera. &gt;
        &gt;
      </blockquote>
      <p>Have you ever noticed that when people take pictures, the
      camera tends to stay in one place - usually at head height -
      and the subjects being photographed position themselves
      around it? People lean into the frame at funny angles and
      wait expectantly for shutter to click… the flash fires and
      it’s one more to add to collection of slightly bleached faces
      beaming at you from the picture.</p>
      <p>There seems to be a standard procedure in taking pictures
      which involves making sure people are smiling even though
      they are unhappy, framing the subject(s) in the central third
      of the image and making sure there are no anomalous
      lamp-posts sticking out of someone’s head when you fire the
      shutter. Well, there is a new cultural phenomenon taking
      place which aims to ditch all the ‘right’ ways of taking
      pictures. You can forget about framing, composition and
      whether the flash went off or not, this is all about freedom
      and letting things happen completely by accident. Train your
      eyes - don’t think…</p>
      <p>Every minute, while your eyes are open and absorbing your
      surroundings, there are millions of images waiting to be
      preserved. In every direction, there are countless
      opportunities to record something; a texture, a reflection, a
      shadow, something out of place, something funny or sad. You
      may be waiting for a bus, or you are a passenger in a car.
      You may be feeding the cat or walking down the street or
      making a cup of tea and suddenly you might see something that
      causes a slight judder of satisfaction. This something might
      seem very mundane to most, but to you it is magical, bizarre
      and enticing. You feel the urge to record this thing you have
      seen so that you can isolate it and prolong it. You may even
      want to show what you have recorded to someone else so that
      they too can enjoy what you have experienced. Enter the world
      of Lomography: the art of photography without thinking.</p>
      <p>Not so long ago, the<a href=
      "http://www.lomo.ru/">Leningradskoe Optiko Mechanichesckoe
      Objedinenie</a> (the Leningrad Optical &amp; Mechanical
      Enterprise) or LOMO was a top-secret Russian company that
      produced optical instruments - telescopes, cameras,
      night-vision devices, cannon sights, periscopes for
      submarines etc. - for the Russian military. Established in
      1917 and originally called the Russian Optical and Mechanical
      Company, it quickly established itself as the leading
      manufacturer of optical instruments in Russia, much of their
      success being attributable to the team of scientists who
      migrated from the German company <a href=
      "http://www.zeiss.com/">Zeiss</a> in 1945 (Zeiss are
      considered to be the ‘<a href=
      "http://www.rollsroyce.com/">Rolls Royce</a>’ of optical
      device manufacturers). In 1983, Lomo started to produce the
      <a href=
      "http://www1.lomo.com/orbiz/DigiTrade/caad50f33b6bb7522af73078b2b6b384e11cb29f2ec2425eab1b8b92d46e254c/0001/shop/single_view.html?artID=54">
      Lomo Kompakt Automat</a> (or the LC-A), a small 35mm camera
      not too dissimilar to a small brick. Many people today
      believe that the Lomo LC-A was created as a spy-camera, which
      would seem to make sense judging by the company’s history.
      The truth of the matter is that the LC-A was the first
      miniature mass-produced camera with automatic exposure in the
      former-USSR. It was a peoples’ camera. The LC-A is now
      considered a mini-masterpiece: it is built to perfection, it
      is durable and has a very high quality lens for super-sharp
      images. About 5 years ago, a group of students in <a href=
      "http://www.magwien.gv.at/english/">Vienna</a>, Austria
      discovered the Lomo and started using it to make images. It
      was perfect for what they needed; it had much of the control
      of an SLR camera but none of the bulk. They photographed
      everything, sucking in the world around them and recklessly
      taking images with no thought about the final outcome. It was
      a kind of liberation from the excepted norms of creating the
      ‘<a href="http://www.anseladams.com/">perfect
      photograph</a>’; the emphasis being on capturing the essence
      of a time or a place through the sheer volume of images
      rather than by an individual, perfectly composed image. In a
      way, it was re-visiting an approach to photography that was
      initiated by <a href="http://www.porto.art.br/bresson/">Henri
      Cartier-Bresson</a> when he found a new level of photographic
      expression using the small and compact <a href=
      "http://www.leica.com/">Leica M</a> in the 1920s (the first
      35mm camera). They called their new photographic movement
      Lomography; an activity that is now - thanks mainly to the
      Internet - a global phenomenon. Anyone can become a member of
      The Lomographic Society (which is still based in Vienna)- all
      you need is a LOMO camera, a load of the cheapest 35mm film
      you can possibly find and a willingness to take your camera
      everywhere you go.‘To collect photographs is to collect the
      world’ - Susan Sontag, On PhotographyIntegral to the whole
      Lomo experience is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World
      Wide Web</a>; through it, Lomo has exploded into a global
      phenomenon. Lomo.com is an attempt at using the ubiquitous
      nature of the web to record the world in images; Lomographers
      from all over the globe are uploading their images to the
      site and gradually a massive archive is being created. The
      images are displayed in huge mosaic-like grids known as
      <a href=
      "http://www1.lomo.com/orbiz/DigiTrade/0001/lomohomes/index.html?user=jeroenvm53">
      Lomowalls</a>; your eyes are overloaded with shapes, colours
      and motifs… no single image stands out, they are all as
      important as each other. What’s unique about Lomography is
      that it is an analog process that has been reliant on the
      digital realm for it’s success around the globe. Even though
      digital photography is slowly and inevitably taking the
      reigns from its chemical based counterpart (you can now get
      adequate digital cameras for under £100), the analog process
      of Lomography is still holding out. Like the charm of a vinyl
      record, there is something so satisfying about pressing the
      shutter release and letting camera film be exposed to light
      for a fraction of a second… it’s a challenge, an unknown,
      things happen by accident. Some might say that digital
      technologies are making things too controlled and too easy…
      we can now preview our images on miniature LCD screens and
      decide to discard them if we don’t like them. There is no
      such luxury with analog, once you’ve pressed the shutter
      release you are committed. Whatever your preference, because
      of its place on the web, the Lomo craze is a compromise
      between the warring factions of analog and digital and it
      demonstrates that the two can live harmoniously.The Lomo
      FamilySo far, you have learned a bit of history of Lomography
      and you have been introduced to the little camera the whole
      craze is built upon, the Lomo LC-A. But recently, the Lomo
      product family has grown, so that if you do intend to become
      a lomographer, you have to make a decision about which type
      of camera to go for. If you’ve heard of Lomo before, it’s
      probably because of the famous ‘<a href=
      "http://www1.lomo.com/orbiz/DigiTrade/caad50f33b6bb752eda407c12d74622b010e38005c3f0779ab1b8b92d46e254c/0001/shop/single_view.html?artID=58">Action
      Sampler</a>’. Resembling something you might give to a 4 year
      old if you want them to grow up to be a hotshot photographer,
      the Action Sampler (in its original form at least) is made
      from tacky coloured plastic, it has no view finder worth
      using, it has no aperture or shutter control and doesn’t use
      batteries. Instead, what makes this camera unique is that it
      has 4 lenses. When you press the magic button, the shutters
      fire sequentially over a second, exposing the film 4 times.
      This means that if you take a picture of a moving object, you
      will capture four slightly different images as the object
      moves in front of the camera. It’s all a bit silly and a tad
      kitsch, but it is this kind of wacky innovation that has
      helped Lomo achieve its cult status. The Action Sampler (or
      the more recent <a href=
      "http://www1.lomo.com/orbiz/DigiTrade/caad50f33b6bb752400770a054c342110114f0654e6824fcab1b8b92d46e254c/0001/shop/single_view.html?artID=89">
      Super Sampler</a>) is ideal if you just want something cheap
      that will serve as an introduction to it all. At the
      relatively inexpensive price of £25, it is a must-buy.
      However, if you intend to use the Action Sampler to take
      pictures in anything other than bright sunshine, then you can
      forget it. Because this camera has a fixed shutter speed,
      fixed aperture and no provision for a flash, it makes
      shooting in dim light very difficult indeed. Next in line is
      the camera for the serious Lomographer, the original Lomo
      LC-A. At £95, this camera is more expensive but worth it; as
      I mentioned earlier, this is a very well made camera with
      many of the features of a larger SLR camera. If you intend to
      become serious about your lomographs, the Lomo LC-A is what
      you need. The most recent addition to the Lomo range is (…
      and you’ll like this), the Elf Night Vision Device; this a
      piece of true Russian military hardware that you can impress
      your friends with. At £180, the Elf Night Vision Device is
      the most expensive in the range, but imagine the fun you
      could have running around in complete darkness and being able
      to see everything around you! Alternatively, you could just
      carry a torch… not quite as cool or subtle though is it?I
      want my Lomo…So you may be wondering how to get hold of a
      Lomo product. First of all, it’s important to note that as
      soon as you buy a Lomo, you are automatically a member of the
      Lomographic Society; this means that you will receive regular
      postings of stuff through your door (all nicely designed bits
      of paper, prints and maybe even the odd lomofilm). There are
      two way of buying yourself a Lomo: you can either visit one
      of the Lomo Embassies which are scattered around the
      continent (the nearest one being in central London) or you
      can buy a Lomo camera from the lomo.com website. Just fill
      out a form, pay by cheque or credit card and a few days
      later, a small parcel with a Lomo and couple of rolls of film
      will arrive and you’re away. It’s important that you take
      your camera everywhere you go… point, click and most
      importantly don’t think! Once you have reeled off a few rolls
      of film, stick them in the Lomobag (which came supplied with
      your camera) and send them to the Lomolab in Austria. For a
      not too expensive fee, they will process your films, upload
      your images to the lomo.com website and send you back your
      new prints. Clever huh? Of course, you don’t have to send
      your films off to the Lomolab, you can get your films
      processed in any photo lab in town. But if you really want to
      be part of the Lomo community, then it’s best to get your
      lomographs developed at the Lomolab; you will have your own
      space at lomo.com (called your Lomohome) in which your can
      store and display and share (via email) your
      images.Lomography is about training your eyes and becoming
      more aware of the world around you. If you buy a camera,
      before you know it, you will be addicted to images, you will
      see the world in a new way, the Lomo will become part of your
      life and you will have a gathered a massive collection of
      images to serve as visual documents of your life. Forget all
      you have learned about taking good pictures, get yourself a
      Lomo and start taking pictures impulsively…stop thinking…
      shoot everything.</p>
