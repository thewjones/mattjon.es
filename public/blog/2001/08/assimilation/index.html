    <h1>Assimilation</h1>
  </header>
  
  
 
  <p>My hopes for my first published piece of writing were dashed when I discovered that the article I had slaved over for most of a sunny weekend was re-written out of existence by the editors of <a href="http://www.the-crack.co.uk">The Crack</a>. I picked up a copy from <a href="http://www.tynecine.org/">The Tyneside</a>, opened it and turned to the page which alleged to contain my work. I stared at it for a few seconds before hastily flicking through the surrounding pages. It was there, assimilated and bastardised into some other junkified piece of lightweight nonsense: &ldquo;This is the sweet Russian mother of Lomo invention&rdquo;[?]&hellip; my name is actually written next to this rubbish. The worst thing is that no-one actually bothered to tell me that they didn&rsquo;t like it; they just ripped it to shreds and scattered the remains onto their own creation. They argued that my piece was too heavy and they had no option but to re-write most of it. I concede that on hindsight, the article was little bit laborious in places which is partly due to my inexperience and lack of knowledge about what the average &lsquo;The Crack&rsquo; reader wants to look at. The least they could have done was let me know. One of the joys of publishing <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/">your own website</a> is that you don&rsquo;t have to care about all this stuff; you just write what you what you want to write and the fact that someone is reading it is an added bonus. I guess I have to put it all down to a &lsquo;learning experience&rsquo; and stick to writing for this site only for the time being.</p>
