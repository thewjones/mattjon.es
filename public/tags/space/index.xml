      <description>Watch a J.J. Abrams science fiction film and a recurring visual motif is the shot of a spaceship in a terrestrial setting. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the shots of the Enterprise built on the Earth-based shipyards in Star Trek (2009), or wrecked Imperial Star Destroyers wedged into the ground of Jakku in Star Trek: The Force Awakens.
Humans, being terrestrial beings, find it easier to understand and experience things in the familiar context of land or sea, where there&amp;rsquo;s obvious up and a down.</description>

      <title>The Science of Doctor Who</title>

      <description>I quite enjoyed Brian Cox&amp;rsquo;s Royal Institution lecture on the science of Doctor Who. The problem for me though is that Doctor Who is as far from being Science Fiction as the Harry Potter series, which is a shame as it was originally conceived as an educational programme that used time travel to explore scientific ideas.</description>

      <title>We need another Cosmos</title>

      <description>Today The Times ran a piece by Sarah Vine (wife of education secretary Michael Gove) criticising the BBC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Wonders of the Universe&amp;rsquo; and its apparently egocentric presenter Brian Cox.
To be fair to Cox itâ€™s probably not his fault that the show is put together in such an over-the-top way. Not even Narcissus himself would have had the brass neck to stipulate this kind of treatment in his contract: long, lingering shots of the handsome professor silhouetted against a night sky, or languid close-ups of him gazing manfully into the middle distance, flashing his white teeth in a carefree yet attractively wistful smile.</description>

      <description>Most of the streaks of light are planes plans passing by. The quicker flashes are meteors, and at 33 seconds you can see one of them explode in the lower left hand corner of the frame.

      <description>This footage of NASA&amp;rsquo;s prototype Mars rover looks like something from a Ray Harryhausen film.
**Update: **I originally posted this on a computer without sound and was unaware of the annoying music. Apologies for that.</description>
