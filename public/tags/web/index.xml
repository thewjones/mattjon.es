      <description>You might have seen the Paxman interview with David Bowie from 1999, in which he talks about the &amp;ldquo;unimaginable potential&amp;rdquo; of the Internet for democratising the music industry.
I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to have experienced the Web in its infancy, and the sense that it was the start of a major and positive development in global knowledge-sharing and communication; the important factor being that it was under the ownership of everyone and not a handful of megacorporations.</description>

      <title>We Are All Netizens Now</title>

      <description>The Net means personal power in a world of little or no personal power (other than those on the top - who are called powerful because of money, but not because of thoughts or ideas). The essence of the Net is Communication, of personal communication between individual people, and between individuals and those who in society who care (and do not care) to listen.
Micheal Hauben - What the Net Means to Me The quote above is taken from an article written 1994, a few years after the invention of the Web and about 14 years before the mass-participation in social media networking sites.</description>

      <title>Google Goes Bing</title>
      <link>https://mattjon.es/blog/2010/06/google-goes-bing/</link>

      <description>Yesterday saw the biggest change to the Google homepage since 1998. They replaced the minimal, functional and revolutionary design of the original - which has remained largely unchanged for 12 years - by adding a Bing-like background image that you could change, but not remove.
Now, a few hours later, Google normality is restored; the &amp;lsquo;Change background image&amp;rsquo; link is there, but it&amp;rsquo;s something you opt into rather than not being able opt out of.</description>

      <title>Getting Typekit to work with Chromium and Namoroka</title>

      <description>Typekit really need to improve the way they do their user-agent detection. At the moment, it seems that if the user-agent-string doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain either &amp;lsquo;Firefox&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Safari&amp;rsquo;, then Typekit won&amp;rsquo;t work, even when the rendering engine is capable of rendering the fonts.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t an issue for many. But it is if you&amp;rsquo;re using a development build of a browser, or you&amp;rsquo;re using a Linux distribution with a modified version of Firefox that, due to licensing restrictions, can&amp;rsquo;t use the Firefox branding.</description>

      <title>The freedom to offend in 140 characters</title>

      <description>We cannot have a web on which a 140 character utterance of criticism against someone else causes a torrent of abuse against the offender and a front-page BBC article about the offendee&amp;rsquo;s intention to quit because of it.
Yesterday, Twitter user Brumplum criticised Stephen Fry by calling his tweets boring, and Stephen Fry reacted by threatening to quit Twitter. We&amp;rsquo;ll look back on this and see how silly it all is, and in future BBC editors with publish more important news.</description>

      <title>HTML Five-O</title>

      <description>At last, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally knocked this site into a shape I&amp;rsquo;m happy with. You&amp;rsquo;ll find no crufty div soup round here. It&amp;rsquo;s all HTML5 goodness and it works on IE8 and IE7 using Remy Sharp&amp;rsquo;s magic HTML5 enabling script.
I found HTML5 to be a bit odd at first, but as I started experimenting with it, the simplicity and meaningfulness of HTML5 mark-up started to sink in. The best way to think of the new elements is something like this:</description>

      <title>Pushing my Luck</title>

      <description>Dammit… I knew I was pushing my luck with IE5/Win and that graphic to the left. For those of you using IE5.0, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that this image has gone a bit awry. This is because I decided to put a drop shadow on the image and the only way to blend it in was to incorporate some of the table formatting in the bitmap itself. Of course, if Microsoft bothered to implement png compatibility into IE5.</description>

      <description>OK. So it&amp;rsquo;s redesigned and it validates, but I&amp;rsquo;m not there yet. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got a layout done in HTML tables, I&amp;rsquo;m going to replace them with CSS formatting in the near future. I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with tables for so long, it&amp;rsquo;s tricky to stop using them.</description>

      <title>All New</title>

      <description>Phew… it&amp;rsquo;s been a struggle, but here it is: the all new frownland.com. This site is now more standards compliant than ever before [validated to XHTML1.0] and should load like the proverbial &amp;lsquo;muck&amp;rsquo; off a shovel now that I have streamlined everything. However, I have absolutely no idea what the page looks like on anything other that IE5 for the Mac&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve only got the W3C HTML Validator to trust. In an ideal world, this should be all I need… unfortunately, life isn&amp;rsquo;t like that is it?</description>
