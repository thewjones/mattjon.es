      <title>Google Goes Bing</title>

      <description>Yesterday saw the biggest change to the Google homepage since 1998. They replaced the minimal, functional and revolutionary design of the original - which has remained largely unchanged for 12 years - by adding a Bing-like background image that you could change, but not remove.
Now, a few hours later, Google normality is restored; the &amp;lsquo;Change background image&amp;rsquo; link is there, but it&amp;rsquo;s something you opt into rather than not being able opt out of.</description>

      <description>At last, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally knocked this site into a shape I&amp;rsquo;m happy with. You&amp;rsquo;ll find no crufty div soup round here. It&amp;rsquo;s all HTML5 goodness and it works on IE8 and IE7 using Remy Sharp&amp;rsquo;s magic HTML5 enabling script.
I found HTML5 to be a bit odd at first, but as I started experimenting with it, the simplicity and meaningfulness of HTML5 mark-up started to sink in. The best way to think of the new elements is something like this:</description>

      <description>Well thank goodness for that. George &amp;lsquo;Dubya&amp;rsquo; Bush is no longer the President of the United States of America, they now seem to have an intelligent and considerate President and the world breathes a sigh of relief.
I thought today would be a good day to relaunch my personal site and consolidate over eight years worth of posts from various blogs I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained and let lapse (although mainly from frownland.com which ran from 2000 to 2005).</description>

      <description>Gateshead Car Park Demolition Project
   In Spring 2008, the [Gateshead Trinity Centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Centre_Multi-Storey_Car_Park), incorporating the controversial &#39;Get Carter&#39; car park, will be demolished.     For 40 years it has dominated the town centre of Gateshead; the vision of its architect [Owen Luder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Luder) having never been fully realised.     The aim of this site is to host and facilitate the production of creative work based around the cultural impact of this building and its demolition.</description>

      <description>In 1991, Richard Dawkins presented the Royal Institution Christmas lectures for Children, and to help illustrate our tendency to think we are superior to the rest of the species on the planet, he invited a member of the audience to read an excerpt from Hitch-hiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy:
Growing up in the Universe
The lecture series, titled &amp;lsquo;Growing up the Universe&amp;rsquo; has recently been released on DVD. I remember it when it was first broadcast on the BBC, and as a 15 year-old who&amp;rsquo;d had a vaguely Christian education and thus had many unanswered questions about our origins, it was a wonderfully inspiring and educational piece of television.</description>

      <title>On Radio 4&#39;s Thought for the Day</title>

      <description>Much as I like Radio 4, the one-sidedness of the Thought for the Day section of the Today programme disappoints me. Why are religious views implicit when we think of Thought for the Day, when there is no such mention of religion in the title?
In 2002, representatives of the British Humanist Association, the National Secular Society and the Rationalist Press Association sent a letter to the BBC complaining about the fact that the two minute, forty-five second slot is only for the broadcasting of religious views.</description>
