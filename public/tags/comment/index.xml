      <description>Today The Times ran a piece by Sarah Vine (wife of education secretary Michael Gove) criticising the BBC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Wonders of the Universe&amp;rsquo; and its apparently egocentric presenter Brian Cox.
To be fair to Cox itâ€™s probably not his fault that the show is put together in such an over-the-top way. Not even Narcissus himself would have had the brass neck to stipulate this kind of treatment in his contract: long, lingering shots of the handsome professor silhouetted against a night sky, or languid close-ups of him gazing manfully into the middle distance, flashing his white teeth in a carefree yet attractively wistful smile.</description>

      <description>When Apple introduced the iPhone, it was like Steve Jobs reached through a mysterious wormhole and pulled from within it an object from five years into the future; its design and user interface were like nothing seen before.
With the iPad, it&amp;rsquo;s like Jobs picked up a five year old magazine article about what Apple might have in store for the future, and based their new product on that. It&amp;rsquo;s even called iPad.</description>

      <title>Fox Hunting Ban</title>

      <description>It looks as though there will be a total ban on fox-hunting, and about time too. I did some documentary photography work at a pro-hunting rally once and I can safely say that the hunt supporters I met there were - stereotypically - a bunch of useless arrogant toffs. Hard luck ladies and gents, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid you&amp;rsquo;re not going to have the enjoyment of chasing a defenceless fox around fields with a large pack of ill-treated dogs, only to watch as they eventually rip their quarry to pieces.</description>

      <title>Train Crisis</title>

      <description>The so called &amp;lsquo;train crisis&amp;rsquo; in the UK is really not as bad as the media is making out. I travelled from Newcastle to Crewe [a 4 hour journey requiring 2 changes of train] without any problems at all. In fact, the trains were completely empty [in the run up to Christmas!?].
As a result of my slightly hectic lifestyle, travelling is the only opportunity I get to have a good think and develop some ideas.</description>
